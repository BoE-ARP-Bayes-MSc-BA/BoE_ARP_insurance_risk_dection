No, on the brand awareness, to be serious, we expect -- you're right, Alka has a very high brand spend. They will continue to have a very high brand spend in the future, because we see that -- again, it's a combination of cost of sales and branding spend. I think that once we have had closing of the transaction, of course, we will do some changes to branding spend. But you should expect that we will continue a higher branding spend on Alka, because combined with a very, very low cost of sale and the 36% online sale, the totality of those 2 is extremely attractive. And there's no doubt that we are not planning to just return to a traditional Tryg model where our branding spend is lower. But then our cost of sale is significantly higher. So some adjustment you should expect, Per. And some of that would also flow into the synergies. But you shouldn't expect a revolution on the branding spend. Then on the head office, on the other hand, it's quite clear that Alka's employees in Denmark are positioned in 3 different locations. They are positioned in Taastrup in Copenhagen area and in -- also in Aarhus and Kolding in Jutland. In all 3 of those locations, we expect that there will be a relocation.

No. On the brand awareness, to be serious, we expect – you're right, Alka has a very high brand spend. They will continue to have a very high brand spend in the future because we see that, again, it's a combination of cost of sales and branding spend. I think that once we have had closing oﬀ of the transaction, of course, we will do some changes to branding spend, but you should expect that we will continue a higher branding spend on Alka because combined with the very, very low cost of sale and a 36% online sale, the totality of those two is extremely attractive. And there's no doubt that we are not planning to just return to a traditional Tryg model where our branding spend is lower, but then our cost of sale is signiﬁcantly higher. So, some adjustments you should expect Per, and some of that would also ﬂow into the synergies, but you shouldn't expect revolution on the branding spend. Then on the head oﬃce, on the other hand, it's quite clear that Alka's employees in Denmark are positioned in three diﬀerent locations. They are positioned in Taastrup in Copenhagen area and also in Aarhus and Kolding  3321 . In all three of those locations, we expect that they will be a relocation. It will happen expectedly in 2019 on all three locations and of course, that will both do something for the culture and also do something for the cost.",Yeah Thank you Per It's nice to see that you're awake twice this morning No On the brand awareness to be serious we expect – you're right Alka has a very high brand spend They will continue to have a very high brand spend in the future because we see that again it's a combination of cost of sales and branding spend I think that once we have had closing oﬀ of the transaction of course we will do some changes to branding spend but you should expect that we will continue a higher branding spend on Alka because combined with the very very low cost of sale and a % on sale the totality of those two is extremely attractive And there's no doubt that we are not planning to just return to a traditional  mo where our branding spend is lower but then our cost of sale is signiﬁcantly higher So some adjustments you should expect Per and some of that would also ﬂow into the synergies but you shouldn't expect revolution on the branding spend Then on the head oﬃce on the other hand it's quite clear that Alka's employees in Denmark are positioned in three diﬀerent locations They are positioned in Taastrup in Copenhagen area and also in Aarhus and Kolding    In all three of those locations we expect that they will be a relocation It will happen expectedly in  on all three locations and of course that will both do something for the culture and also do something for the cost,morning brand awareness brand brand spend future combination cost sale branding oﬀ transaction course change branding branding cost sale % sale totality doubt mo branding spend cost sale adjustment synergy revolution branding head oﬃce hand employee diﬀerent location area location relocation location course culture cost,"['brand', 'awareness', 'brand', 'brand', 'spend', 'combination', 'branding', 'oﬀ', 'brand', 'branding', 'totality', 'doubt', 'branding', 'spend', 'synergy', 'revolution', 'branding', 'head', 'oﬃce', 'employee', 'location', 'location', 'relocation', 'location', 'culture']",41,259,14,6.317073170731708,2.9285714285714284,25,0.0024084388,0.0034073223,0.006994108,0.0042904317,0.001578336,0.6882038,0.00357281,0.003599491,0.003730633,0.07725914,0.0038936154,0.0047952873,0.0042748507,0.0025783565,0.0052153547,0.038680833,0.0035124307,0.0781445,0.004222283,0.0018730327,0.0039950674,0.039052878,0.00044229403,0.0033428944,0.0027350015,0.0034633111,0.0047334265,topic_6

I mean, we have disclosed the number of transaction we do daily in the Tobacconist network which has grown signiﬁcantly over the pandemic, so let's say, over one year ago. And part of this business that we do is the parcel business. So we deliver and we pick up from Tobacconist and there are 10,800 which are today allowed to do parcel for us, every day something like 19,000 pieces per day. It's an interesting business for both of us, because this gives us the opportunity to do one stop with several deliveries and it gives the Tobacconist the opportunity to see clients and traﬃc. And maybe clients once they go to pick up or deliver a parcel, they will also buy something. So that's our strategy. And you know that in any developed market, you have around 20% to 25% of deliveries, which are going into lockers and pickup points in urban areas, call it 25%. So if you control the bulk of that network, you have a good market share of the B2C even in urban areas. So this was since the beginning one way to protect our B2C strategy also versus the giants and the likes of Amazon, that clearly we'll go into urban areas ﬁrst. So if you own at least the lockers and pick up points, you protect the one portion of that market. And this was your last question Matija. In terms of your ﬁrst question, I'm looking for two ﬁgures, the market share of Poste Italiane, in B2C, Italy is 37% and the growth of the market in B2C in 2020 was around 50% and we grew as you know 60%. The second question, I'm not sure I understood it. But it was the macro growth coming back and this probably improving our expectation on volumes of mail. Maybe Camillo, you got it?",   Yeah I'll st with the last point I mean we have disclosed the number of transaction we do daily in the Tobacconist network which has grown signiﬁcantly over the pandemic so let's say over one year ago And p of this  that we do is the parcel  So we iver and we pick up from Tobacconist and there are  which are today allowed to do parcel for us every day something like  pieces per day It's an interesting  for both of us because this gives us the opporty to do one stop with several iveries and it gives the Tobacconist the opporty to see cnts and traﬃc And maybe cnts once they go to pick up or iver a parcel they will also buy something So that's our  And you know that in any developed market you have around % to % of iveries which are going into lockers and pickup points in urban areas call it % So if you  the bulk of that network you have a good market share of the BC even in urban areas So this was since the beginning one way to protect our BC  also versus the giants and the likes of Amazon that clearly we'll go into urban areas ﬁrst So if you own at least the lockers and pick up points you protect the one portion of that market And this was your last question  In terms of your ﬁrst question I'm looking for two ﬁgures the market share of Poste Italiane in BC Italy is % and the growth of the market in BC in  was around % and we grew as you know % The second question I'm not sure I unstood it But it was the macro growth coming back and this probably improving our expectation on volumes of mail Maybe  you got it?,point number transaction network pandemic year p parcel today parcel day piece day opporty iverie opporty cnt traﬃc cnt parcel market % % iverie locker pickup point area bulk network market share area beginning way giant like area locker point portion market question term question ﬁgure market share % growth market % question growth expectation volume mail,"['network', 'pandemic', 'parcel', 'parcel', 'piece', 'iverie', 'traﬃc', 'parcel', 'iverie', 'locker', 'pickup', 'bulk', 'network', 'giant', 'locker', 'portion', 'ﬁgure', 'mail']",49,281,17,5.73469387755102,2.8823529411764706,18,0.0032227207,0.004559322,0.009358783,0.0057410067,0.002111964,0.6793857,0.00478076,0.004816462,0.10159059,0.055080764,0.0052100285,0.006416551,0.0057201576,0.0034500868,0.0069786413,0.0034593167,0.004699967,0.007966145,0.005649817,0.0025062962,0.0053457804,0.0039571496,0.0005918316,0.004473111,0.0036596926,0.052933563,0.006333776,topic_6
