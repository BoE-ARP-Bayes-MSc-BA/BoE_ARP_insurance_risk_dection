So, I'll answer the question slightly differently in that we haven't mentioned it here, but you've all heard us talk before about the normalized combined ratio. I think one of the positives in the results is we talked last year about our normalized combined ratio. So, where we simply normalize for what we consider to be a normal cat year. We don't ignore claims in that, which is what does a normal historical and look forward cat year look like. And if you normalize that in our results, then the combined ratio is around about 102, whereas last year, we were talking to you about around – about 105, so I think that's a really positive part. Then if you expand that, so that includes a cat load of around about 9%. So, we assume that every year and trends are changing, but we think that 9%, 9.5% is our normal expected cat load. So, we would therefore expect the market to be profitable, including a 9.5% cat load. Then what would the attritional look like, and the reason I'm answering different  003451  I don't think it's that simple, partly because some syndicates are pure cat syndicates and some are pure attritional syndicates. But it's also we look at the total combined ratio and we have an expense load of about 39%, 40%, and a claims load of about 60%, and we've got to attack both of those things. So, for sure, I think there's a bit of improvement in the attritionals in certain areas and a lot in some areas, but we need to attack so that that combined expense and claims ratio in a normal 9.5% cat year is still profitable.

It's not requiring you to further increase loss picks or is it and that's being offset by something else? Or is it causing you to think about the seasoning of loss picks and maybe holding onto reserves for a bit longer because of the uncertainty of the environment. So I'm just trying to reconcile the phraseology not immune versus it doesn't sound like it's causing you to kind of change guidance.

Really, as we all know, the market has been under some pressure for some time. We have always carried out various schematic reviews of different classes of business and syndicates where we were concerned about pricing. And we do obviously constantly monitor people's technical pricing and rate change to see whether or not they look appropriate and in line with the market. What we did announce in May was a portfolio review, where we're going to take a far more – far reaching and comprehensive approach to doing that. And in doing that, what we did was we identified the most challenged and  003026  performing classes. So, those classes where we were seeing, for example, very high lost ratios or combined ratios, but at the same time, we're seeing significant growth once where we weren't comfortable with the price benchmarking, et cetera, and we have been doing as part of our review of 2017 plans. We've identified the bottom quartile in all of those classes and we have been working with them to ensure that they have a robust re-underwriting or review of those classes to make sure that either that business is stopped or changed. But in any event, they look to seek to reduce exposures or to increase pricing accordingly. Now, we've just got that detail in with the September plans, but what we have seen in the high-level discussions that we had already with the syndicates in July was that that is already starting to have an impact on how syndicates are approaching those classes in terms of both loss ratio and premium volume.

Part of the evidence of that is what I referenced earlier in response to Kai, in terms of how our accident year combined ratios or loss picks have developed. Right now your question is very focused on the insurance side, and understandably so, you never know in any of these lines of business. We have a couple of hundred different IBNR groups. Clearly, in each year we have redundancies in some, and deficiencies in others. So this is a natural occurrence in the complete reserving process.
