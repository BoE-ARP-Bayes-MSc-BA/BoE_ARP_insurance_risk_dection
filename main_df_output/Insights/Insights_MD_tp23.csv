1049,Jean-Martin Folz,20170426_AXA_SA-_Shareholder_Mtg_Call_2017-4-26_SD000000002905864394.pdf,2017-04-26,627.0,1,0,AXA SA-," 1396964  So following this presentation of the governance of AXA in 2016, I would now like to give you a vote on the Remuneration Committee. In compliance with the recommendations of the AfepMedef Code, your meeting is being asked to vote on the elements of -- I beg your pardon, on the remuneration of each corporate officer in 2016 and also for 2017. There will be 6 resolutions put to your vote. Two for the remunerations ex post of previous executives, 2 for ex post compensation of the CEO and Chairman of the Board and 2 ex ante resolutions for the CEO and Chairman of the Board. In this context, you will see summarized here the various components of the remuneration of the executives of AXA. There's a fixed remuneration and also, annual variable. There will also be elements of the deferred compensation, which is, in part, annual variable compensation and also, stock options and performance shares. The objective is to encourage the convergence of the interests of management with those of the shareholders for the medium and long term. The Remuneration and Governance Committee made some proposals to the board concerning the remuneration of the corporate executives. In preparing these proposals, the committee established a comprehensive appreciation of all the elements taken into account in the compensation. The committee studied the practice in terms of compensation and the reference benchmark companies comparable to AXA at the European and global level in order to propose a consistent and coherent structure at competitive levels that will encourage performance and align the actual compensation received based on the results of the company. The Remuneration and Governance Committee and regularly reviews the general principles of the compensation policy of the group. And the committee also takes into account the individual performance. Following the succession process previously referred to, the board set the remuneration of the CEO and the Chairman of the Board as of the 1st of September, 2016. The board thus decided to set the annual target remuneration of the CEO at EUR 2,900,000. This remuneration consists of fixed compensation and variable target. The fixed annual remuneration of the CEO is EUR 1,450,000 and the target annual variable remuneration, which is entirely subject to conditions of performance, deriving from group strategies, also at EUR 1,450,000. The determining of the amounts of the balance between the fixed and the variable is based on the advice given by an external advisory committee and giving opinions based on the main samples in the CAC 40 and major European insurance companies. Also, in order to associate the CEO with the creation of value, the board established to allocate long-term incentives, LTIs, in the form of stock options and performance shares. These LTIs are fully subject to conditions of performance and therefore, do not guarantee at all any allocation of minimum profit. These LTIs positions so as to give the overall compensation, both in kind and in shares in the median for the third quartile of market benchmarks. The CEO will not benefit from additional retirement benefits and will be benefiting, as all senior executives in the AXA Group, with performance shares dedicated to pension, with attribution based on results obtained annually. And in the case of termination of the functions, these conditions of performance and -- are equal to 12 months of the remuneration. This can be increased by 1 additional month for each year of seniority without, however, being able to exceed 24 months. The target compensation of the CEO will remain the same in 2017 as was decided in September 2016. The board also determined the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board. Following recommendations of the Remuneration and Governance Committee and in compliance and accordance with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, the board considered the bestsuited remuneration structure for the Chairman of the Board would be to have a fixed compensation as the only element. In the context of the amount of this compensation, the board consulted an external consultant and undertook significant missions given to Denis Duverne as Chairman of the Board. And in addition, the board took into account the fact that Denis Duverne who accept to go into retirement on the 1st of 1st of September, 2016, decided to renounce the payment of his annuity, which is in total some EUR 750,000. Denis Duverne decided to only benefit from once his mandate as Chairman of the Board is terminated and without application of any retroactive payment. And the board consequently decided to set the annual compensation of the Chairman of the Board to EUR 1.2 million and this compensation will remain unchanged in 2017 and shall continue to be (inaudible) consist of fixed compensation. I suggest now that we look at the variable compensation given to the corporate officer of the company, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ph and Deputy Chief Executive Officer until 1st of September. The evaluation of this annual performance is -- consists of the group performance for 50%. And individual performance for 50%. The performance of the group is appreciated based on the evolution of the underlying earnings per share and of the return on equity and on the Customer Satisfaction Index. The indicators retained are directly related to the strategic orientation of the group and are built on a budget or score that has been established ex ante. And on screen, you have the weight of each of these indicators. The group performance in 2016 was thus established at 98%. The individual performance, which accounts for 50% of annual variable compensation, is based on specific objectives that are reviewed every year. On the different indicators and qualitative and quantitative objectives, are defined by the board in a letter of admission, decided before the period of the -- to be measured. In the context of the individual performance of Thomas Buberl as CEO as of the 1st of September, 2016, the board examined the reaching of 4 objectives set to -- by this letter of admission the implementation of the new governance model for 30%; the preparation and presentation of the new strategic plan for the group, Ambition 2020 for 30%; development of strategic orientation at 20%; and the strengthening of the group internal controls at 20% also. And the individual performance of the general -- of the Chief Executive Officer was set for four months and it was established at 100% by the board. On this slide now, you see the compensation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. And the Deputy Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board and the CEO for 2016. The board decided to produce ph for 2016 for the Chairman and the CEO, the payment of a deferred amount equal to 30% of their variable compensation for 2016. The amount will vary based on the stock price of the AXA share for the period deferred within the limit of a threshold of 80% and a ceiling of 100% of the deferred amount. Introduction of the deferred part, even though not required legally at present, is nevertheless intended to reinforce the alignment of AXA with current practice and regulations in the financial insurance sector in France and internationally. AXA also defined to give performance shares to its employees in France and internationally. These allocations are given each year. All options given to the members of the board and including the CEO, are subject to performance, only if the performance of the AXA share exceeds that of the reference stock index, which is the SXIP Index. The board considered that for options in 2017, these options will be suspended in case of a negative group share earnings for the group. All performance shares, whatever their beneficiaries, are subject to performance conditions that apply to 100% of the shares allocated. This is based on the group performance of 40% and the performance of the entity to which the beneficiary belongs for 50% and the performance of the group in terms of CSR, Corporate Social Responsibility. And this last criteria is based on the reference CSR Index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, DJSI, which accounts for 10% of the overall performance. And in conclusion, in line with the best practices in the market and recommendations of the regulators, the performance shares are set with a period -- the vesting -- minimum vesting period of three years and the mandatory investing of at least two years. And the stock options are linked to a measure, the effective operation for a period of at least three years. In June 2016, the board proceeded with the allocation of options and performance shares to a large number of beneficiaries. No performance share and no option was allocated to the Chairman and CEO, nor to the Deputy CEO in 2016. The shares and -- the performance shares and options given in 2016 to Mr. Thomas Buberl were done before his appointment as CEO and are presented here for your information. The evidence of compensation of the AXA executives, as described here, are described even more in detail on the reference document for AXA 2016, which are available at the entrance to this room or on the website of the company and I invite you to consult with that if you need further clarification. On the screen now, you see the attribution of stock options between 2010 and 2016. Since 2013, the decision was then to limit the attribution of options only to the executive managers of the group and this explains the reduction in number of beneficiaries. And you will note as in previous years, over 7,300 group employees have benefited from performance shares in 2016. And let me underscore the fact that these allocations were given without any dilution for shareholders, based on the choice to only deliver existing shares. Next June, the board will undertake a new allocation of performance shares and stock options. In conclusion, let me say a couple of words about the group policy in terms of employee shareholding and the capital of AXA. In March 2012, the board allocated 50 free shares to each AXA employee in the context of a newer operation called AXA Miles, similar to the one that had already taken place in 2007. Following this acquisition period of 2 to four years, depending on the countries, the AXA Miles then opened up the right to AXA shares and thus, in 2016, following the acquisition period of four years, some 44,000 employees of the group benefiting from the AXA Miles program received 50 AXA shares. And in addition, AXA has for a long time, been undertaking a very proactive policy in terms of employee shareholding. And each year, the group offers to its employees in France and internationally, a shareholding plan called Share Plan. In 2016, over 28,000 employees in 36 countries participated in the capital increase operation for a total amount underwritten of over EUR 430 million. On the 31st of December, 2016, the group employees and agents hold 5.7% of AXA's equity. I do ask to be excused for this far too long presentation. But thank you for your attention.",   So following this presentation of the governance of  in  I would now like to give you a vote on the Remuneration  In compliance with the recommendations of the

We wanted to have the opportunity to brief you in person following our important announcements of this morning. I'm joined in the room by my colleagues of the executive committee of Ageas and our Investor Relations team. We also have members of our legal team here today in the event you ask more technical questions. This morning, I'd like together with Filip to provide some further context to the settlement, expand on what it means for Ageas, and importantly, what it means for potential claimants. I will also outline the next steps, as this is one of a process that takes time before being completed. As CEO of Ageas and on behalf of our entire board and management team, I'm very pleased that in conjunction with the number of claimants' organizations, we are in a position to put forward for the first time the complete proposal for global settlement related to the Fortis events of 2007 and 2008. And just to be clear, this is without admitting any wrong doing on the part of Ageas. Clearly, this had been a difficult few years for everyone. The events of 2007 and 2008 caused a great deal of anger, frustration, and financial losses for many families, individuals and investors. Ageas, I'm pleased that we have been able to arrive at the proposal that will provide some compensation for those financial losses but also for the sorrows caused. There is, of course, no perfect solution for every individual or every organization, but I'm hopeful that all parties will see the benefit of opting for an amicable solution and that this will help all parties to draw a line and what has been a lengthy and complex legal process. Regarding today thanks also to the claimants' organizations involved being Deminor, Stichting FortisEffect, SICAF and VEB, who showed the willingness to sit around the table and talk. These parties represent a vast majority of the shares represented by active claimants, and as such, we felt comfortable and also obliged to communicate the details of this settlement. In reaching this agreement, I can assure you that all parties have strived to arrive at a fair allocation of the total settlement amount to the eligible shareholders. As a group, we of course welcome this settlement as an important step forward in allowing us to regain full strategic and financial flexibility. The settlement brings with it greater certainty and transparency around this long outstanding issue. We will also be able to focus exclusively on our core business and the realization of our Ambition 2018 strategic plan that we announced in September last year. For our current and our future shareholders, I believe that lifting the uncertainty caused by the open legal action can only lead to a more transparent valuation of Ageas. Due to the legal structure of the agreement, you will appreciate that we are not in a position today to disclose all the details on the proposed settlement, but those details will be available in due time and eligible shareholders will be informed accordingly. The proposed settlement falls under the Dutch Act on the Collective Settlement of Mass Damage Claims, the so-called Wet Collectieve Afwikkeling Massaschade or WCAM. In short, WCAM is a legal procedure under Dutch law whereby parties through an out of court settlement agreement can jointly request that the court in this case, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, declare the proposed settlement binding on all beneficiaries of the settlement. It's very important to mention that the WCAM procedure is also by law an opt-out procedure or in other words not an obtained procedure. This means that all eligible shareholders are bound by the settlement if the court issues a binding declaration, unless they opt-out. But before taking the final decision, the court firstly has to test two crucial elements among other things. One, the representativeness of the organizations, and two, the reasonableness of the proposed settlement. We're all confident that the proposed settlement will meet those requirements and will receive the approval of the court. And lastly, the settlement agreement is also subject to a termination right. This refers to the right of Ageas to terminate the settlement, if the agreed opt-out ratio is exceeded, which is a legally foreseen possibility in the WCAM procedure. This legal procedure has existed under Dutch law since 2005, and so far, eight settlements have been declared binding, among which the Shell settlement is perhaps the best known. Ladies and gentlemen, I propose now to hand over to Filip Coremans, our Chief Risk Officer, also responsible for legal to provide you more details about the settlement procedure.",   Ladies and

proposed settlement but those details will be available in due time and eligible sharehols will be informed accordingly The proposed settlement falls un the Dutch Act on the Collective Settlement of  Damage Claims the so-called Wet Collectieve Afwikkeling aschade or WCAM In short WCAM is a legal procedure un Dutch law whereby pies through an out of court settlement agreement can jointly request that the court in this case the Amsterdam Court of Appeal declare the proposed settlement binding on all beneficiaries of the settlement It's very important to mention that the WCAM procedure is also by law an opt-out procedure or in other words not an obtained procedure This means that all eligible sharehols are bound by the settlement if the court issues a binding declaration unless they opt-out But before taking the final decision the court firstly has to test two crucial elements among other things One the representativeness of the organizations and two the reasonableness of the proposed settlement We're all confit that the proposed settlement will meet those requirements and will receive the approval of the court And lastly the settlement agreement is also subject to a termination right This refers to the right of  to terminate the settlement if the agreed opt-out ratio is exceeded which is a legally foreseen possibility in the WCAM procedure This legal procedure has existed un Dutch law since  and so far eight settlements have been declared binding among which the Shell settlement is perhaps the best known Ladies and gentlemen I propose now to hand over to  emans our

On the screen now, you have the board, which numbers 16 members, 7 non-French, 7 women and 9 men. The proportion of women today at the board is 44% and following this general meeting and with or to reserve of your approval, the board will consist of 14 members, 6 women and 8 men. And that's 43% women. Thus, exceeding the threshold recommended by the Afep-Medef Code and legal provisions. Also, the outcome of this meeting and the reservation from your approval, the board will consist of 15 members of non; and French nationals. This diversity, which associates different functions and career paths, does give depth and quality to the discussions of the board and among the criteria defined during the selection procedure for members of the board is the quest for the required and adequate balance between technical skills and professional experience of the directors and as well as diversity in terms of age, nationality and culture. Every year too, the board examines these in situation of independence of each of its members in light of the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code. And at the beginning of 2017, the board considered that 12 out of its 16 members were to be considered as independent. On screen now, you have a summary of how the board operates. Let me remind you that it is up to the board to take the most important decisions and, in particular, to decide on separating or not, the functions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. As you know, following the decision by Mr. Henri de Castries to leave his role as Chairman and CEO last September, the board decided to separate the functions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. And entrusted the role of the Chairman to Denis Duverne, who, prior to that, the Deputy General, CEO. And the board nominator and to Thomas Buberl as Chief Executive of AXA co-opted as a board member from 1st of September, 2016. And these decisions were taken after in-depth reflection and preparation of the succession of the general management presented by Mr. Norbert Dentressangle our last general meeting and these reflect the conclusions of the board, which considered that separating the functions and roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer would be the best choice for the company at this stage of its development. The board considered that the separation would make it possible for the group to build on the complementarity of experience and skills and competencies of Mr. Thomas Buberl and Denis Duverne, while providing for a fluid transition from the previous organization. In this new governance structure, the board (inaudible) from the work provided by the 3 committees. And which seen through the various recommendations. And as my position as Lead Independent Director, I make sure that independent directors do, indeed, play the role that is expected of them. And I take part at each preparatory meeting for the board meetings and also meetings with the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. We also send out the agenda and the calendar for all the meetings. Concerning the work of the board, 2016 was a very busy year. The board met 11 times, with an average presence of 97% of the board members. The 3 committees held 13 -- 17 meetings in 2016, with an average presence of 98%. The main topics covered by the board during the past year, I can mention the following. First of all, the succession plan of the corporate offices, which was the main issue for last year; the group strategy and more specifically, the Ambition 2020 plan presented in June last year; the discussion of the annual and half-year accounts; significant acquisitions and divestments; a review of the internal risks and solvency; and the internal model of AXA; and the established policies under the regulations of Solvency II, the policy for distributing dividends; and the composition of the board and its committees. As in other years, the board also decides to assess its own functioning. In 2016, this was undertaken by an external consultant who collected the contributions and opinions of each director as well as their assessments and suggestions for the operation of the board. And brought also the opinion of each director on the participation and contribution of all the other members of the board. The Chairman of the Board, then personally, communicated to each of the directors, doing individual meetings, the conclusions pertaining to their individual contribution and I reported to the President of the conclusions pertaining to his contribution. General conclusions of the self-assessment and the main focus of progress is exhibited ph by the Remuneration Governance Committee was given with the recommendations and approved by the board last December. The directors expressed a very favorable opinion as to how the board operates, in particular, underlining the excellent unfolding of the succession process. And where all the recommendations were very widely effected and with positive outcome. The main items for improvement, they're on the sending a more regularly of notes and information following the meetings of the board. And also recommended the organization of a visit for -- of an operational entity in a country with a strategy for the group. And also suggested that each new director be mentored by a more senior or longer standing member of the board when they join the board. And the outcome of the vote will follow will be the renewal of 2 (inaudible)  One is Mrs. Deanna Oppenheimer and Mr. Ramon de Oliveira. They are well known by your meeting because they have been present with the board of the company since 2013 and 2009. During this vote, you will also be asked to ratify the co-opting of Thomas Buberl and Andre Francois-Poncet as directors. The co-opting of Thomas Buberl was decided by the board at its meeting of 1st of September, 2016. The board considered that the appointment as a Director of Mr. Thomas Buberl would make it possible to ensure the representation of the Executive Committee of the group and the board and thus, enrich its work. The co-opting of Mr. Andre Francois-Poncet was decided at the meeting on 14th of December, 2016, to replace Mr. Norbert Dentressangle who chose to cease his responsibility and I take this opportunity on behalf of the whole board to thank Norbert Dentressangle for his very effective work as the Lead Independent Director on the board and Vice Chairman of the Board until December 2016. In favor of the appointment of Andre Francois-Poncet, the board noted his significant wealth of experience and in-depth knowledge of the insurance industry. Mr. Andre Francois-Poncet was working with CIAM and Morgan Stanley and BC Partners in Paris and London. I suggest now that we look at a brief film presenting Andre Francois-Poncet, who is sitting in the front row of this meeting.",   Ladies and gentlemen dear sharehols as Lead Indepent  that it is my

And good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you very much for joining us on this conference call right towards the end of December, when I know you all want to be on a leave. I'm joined today on the call by Abigail Mukhuba, Mlondolozi Mahlangeni and Grant Davids. Abigail is our CFO; Lotz, our Chief Actuary and Chief Risk Officer; and Grands Davids, the Head of Investor Relations at Sanlam. Today we announced that agreement has reached with African Rainbow Capital Financial Services, short ARCFS, whereby Sanlam would acquire a 25% non-controlling minority shareholding in a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARC Financial Services known as ARC Financial Services SubCo subject to the fulfillment of certain substantive conditions. Today's announcement follows a circular to shareholders in November 2018 where it was envisaged that ARC Financial Services would assist Sanlam in the execution of its South African strategy to enhancing empowerment in the financial services sector and in its own operations. In addition, it was agreed that ARC Financial Services would amongst other things, hold strategic investments funded by way of the Ubuntu-Botho preference share facility. Through this investment now, Sanlam will share in the value creation within the underlying ARC Financial Services SubCo investments. A short summary of the transaction is as follows. Firstly, there's the creation ARC Financial Services SubCo into which ARC Financial Services will transfer its investments in financial services other than those interest it has in banking-related investments, namely TymeBank, AI Fund and Ooba. Definitely, Sanlam will acquire 25% minority shareholding in ARC Financial Services SubCo through a combination of a subscription for new shares in ARC Financial Services SubCo and the acquisition of shares from ARC Financial Services. And finally, any amount drawn down under the ZAR2 billion preference share facility approved by Sanlam shareholders to be given to Ubuntu-Botho investments are also being transferred from ARC Financial Services to ARC Financial Services SubCo While the necessary security remains in place for this preference share facility. More detail on the transaction value was given in our SENS announcement. Transaction is funded from Sanlam Life's existing cash resources. Proposed transaction is categorized as a small related party transaction. Accordingly, the Sanlam Board appointed BDO Corporate Finance as independent expert to provide the Board with a Fairness Opinion. BDO has provided a Fairness Opinion to Sanlam Board confirming that the terms of the proposed transactions are fair to Sanlam shareholders. This opinion has been provided to the JSE and will be available for inspection upon request. In summary, this transaction strengthens Sanlam's long-term strategic partnership with Ubuntu-Botho and creates the opportunity for further growth in South Africa. Sanlam is very well positioned to serve a wide range of clients and through our partnership with Ubuntu-Botho, we are continuing to create tremendous value for a very broad set of stakeholders across South African society. I'm now going to open the call for questions and I'll direct them to whichever my colleagues is best able to handle them. Claudia, if you wouldn't mind opening the line now to call.

248,Bart Karel de Smet,20160314_Ageas_SA-NV-_M-A_Call_2016-3-14_FS000000002260325817.pdf,2016-03-14,188.0,1,0,Ageas SA-NV-," 16272635  Thank you, Filip. Ageas has also issued in parallel to the joint press release a second announcement. As part of its standard governance process, Fortis had insurance policies in place for its directors and officers, the D&Os, to cover them against their general responsibility to manage the company, but also more specifically, with respect to the public rights issue, which took place in 2007. Until recently, the D&O insurance refused their intervention in the context of these policies and Ageas went to court to challenge this position. Today, Ageas, as legal successor of Fortis and all D&O insurance companies, agreed a settlement whereby the insurance will contribute a settlement amount of €290 million. Under this settlement, Ageas and all directors and officers involved in litigations and BNP Paribas Fortis released the insurers from all responsibility under the policies. In the return for the release given by D&Os and BNP Paribas Fortis, Ageas agreed to provide them some protections. This amount of €290 million will be used as partial funding for the global settlement agreed with the claimants' organization with respect to the Fortis events in 2007 and 2008. The proposed settlement does not free-up Ageas from all civil and criminal procedures. A criminal procedure in Belgium is not and cannot be included in the settlement and the persons opting out retain the right to initiate or to continue civil legal proceedings. Before opening up for Q&A, let me briefly comment on the financial impact of this transaction for Ageas. First of all, the financial impact of the transactions will be recognized in the Q1 2016 IFRS financial statements that will be published of May 19, 2016. The following items are the main areas of impact. First of all, and I refer you to slide four in the back, the group net results. The net impact of the various transactions amounts to €889 million and this is the result of the provision of €1.204 billion plus €45 million related to the agreement with the claimants' organizations, plus an additional provision of €62 million related to the tail risk which we estimated 5% of the total settlement amount. And from this amount, we deduct the settlement amount with the D&O insurance of €290 million, but also the provision for litigation that we set up in 2014 in the context of the FortisEffect judgment which amounted to €132.6 million. Secondly, the Solvency II position, the Insurance Solvency II ratio that stood at 182% end of 2015 remains, of course, unaffected, while the estimated impact on the group Solvency II ratio based on the situation end of 2015 is 20% negative, and would bring the reported 212% down to a still comfortable level of 192% if the settlement would have been accounted for end 2015. And lastly, the net cash position in general accounts, we'll remember that at the end of 2015, we were at €1.6 billion, including the so-called liquid assets. Taking into account the settlement amount received from the insurers, the net cash out over time will be around €1 billion, which is the sum of the WCAM settlement, the claimants' organizations costs and expenses, plus the tail risk minus the expected amounts to be contributed by the insurers. However, here it is important to note that this amount will be gradually released over an expected period of two years to three years and certainly not in the 18 months to come. Finally, to avoid all misunderstanding, the proposed gross dividend of 2015, which was set at €1.65 per share in cash, remains of course unaffected, as this settlement does not affect our insurance results. Ladies and gentlemen, when I became CEO of Ageas in 2009, I knew there was a lot to be done. We have worked very hard over the past years to restructure and strengthen our insurance operations. At the same time, we have gradually sought all legacy issues taking the necessary time for each in order to come to good solutions. And I refer here in the first place to the settlements reached with the Dutch and the Belgium state, but also the sale of Royal Park Investments, the sale of the BNP Paribas call option, and the two transactions concluded with BNP Paribas, regarding the RPN(I). This recent agreement is a crucial step for Ageas, bringing greater certainty and transparency, and allowing an even greater focus on our core insurance business. Looking forward, the agreement allows the company to regain full strategic and financial flexibility, and the management can even more than before focus exclusively on the delivery of our strategic plans. It was perhaps an undisclosed item within our Ambition 2018 to bring this outstanding legacy to an end, but I do hope that by 2018, this part of our history will be firmly behind us, and we can continue to make important progress in our goal as a sustainable international insurance company.",   Thank you   has also issued in parallel to the joint press release a second announcement As p of

I'm on the Executive Committee of the Investment Analysts Society. And its my pleasure on behalf of this committee and all our members that are here today to welcome you. And specifically to welcome Discovery, for coming and talking to us as they so regularly do and keeping the investment community informed about what is happening with the Company and its prospects. This is a company that is -- enormous strides within South Africa, not only in the investment community. But also in the daily lives of many South Africans. So these are very important results and very important for us to know what is happening with the Company. And, of course, there's all the international operations as well.
