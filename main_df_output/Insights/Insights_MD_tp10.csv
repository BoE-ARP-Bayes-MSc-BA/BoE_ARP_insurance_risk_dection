Don, I think the reality is the multi-line approach works much better, and I'll give you a couple of reasons; number one, cycle management and we talk about this very frequently with all lines of our business. And what you see here on this slide is an effective demonstration of cycle management. We are return focused, we're not market share focused. We're not volume focused. There is way too much emphasis on quarterly market share movements within the MI industry. This is showing that we have actively managed our portfolio. You can see over time, rate levels have come down, and this is showing a rate index average across the year. So it does potentially obscure some micro trends, especially as we've seen movement up and down by quarter in 2019 and 2020, although the overall rate level is generally flat for the year. So it obscures some trends, but you can see as rate levels have come down, so has our market share. And we're able to create a better portfolio. And when you look at our portfolio, and you look at our mix by state, and you look at our high DTI, and you look at our high loan-to-value, and you look at the split between monthly and single premiums, and you look at our DQ rate compared to other companies that have a legacy business, you can see demonstrated cycle management and the impact that it has become. So the benefit is we've made over $3 billion of underwriting the comp in the last four years in mortgage insurance. And now, that money is being utilized by the Insurance and Reinsurance Group to support their growth opportunities. So you can see the benefit of having the multi-line approach. And I would say also, lastly, as we look at the time line, again, a lot of information here, but I think the key point is multi-line and internal competition spurs innovation, right? Innovation has required us to continually improve our business, to continually get better, to continually innovate because we're always competing for capital, and we can't just sit back and only write primary MI business regardless of rate level, right? We recognize that it's a competitive situation, rate levels vary and we want to maximize the return for our shareholders. That means we manage the cycle in MI, and we explore other opportunities, and some of those exploration are going to create great new opportunities. Some of them are not. So a big, big difference for us compared to some of the others out there, and we think it's a superior business model over time. And in 2020, it was demonstrated, right. If you look at our market share, the fact that we have come down and you look at others, right, that business has gone somewhere, it doesn't go away, right. Market share that adds up to 200. So I think we do demonstrate the value of that.

And then let me summarize on page 37, where do we stand and how are we doing with respect to our Ambition 2018. I think EPS growth is on a good track. Our ROE is still below our 13% target, but I think we have less of an earnings problem because I think the earnings have developed since we put up the target well above, but our equity did even better. So, our €2 billion share buyback program, which we announced on top to our Q3 results and we have not yet mentioned today. It's certainly, also helping to get our ROE in the right perspective, that's ratio between strong earnings and adequate equity results into the right number. The combined ratio is 94% after nine months but with a very diﬃcult quarter as the industry and most of our peers have shown. So, we are – feel comfortable about our next year's target. Our Life OEs, as they're making the 10% ROE, we are convinced that we are getting it to a very strong number, maybe not 100.0% but already in the direction of 100%. Life new business margin we talked about, we are on target. PIMCO cost income ratio, interest rate sensitivity, we are pretty much on target and also IMIX is actually a latest measurement of our asking our employees on (2255) and engagement in 72% is a very recent number where our NPS measurement is already sometime old and will be updated then with the next round of market surveys. So, with this one, I think I would move to the Q&A and happy to learn what really interest you (2325) already.

Thank you, Christian, for the nice introduction. Good morning. I brought something along for you. This is a commercial-grade sensor that was a design by one of our IoT teams, part of Greg's team at HSB. And you will hear more about what we do there later today. And that sensor, I will pass it around in a moment, that measures things like temperature, motion, vibration. You can attach it to a machine. You can learn from the sensor if the machine runs hot. You can learn from that sensor if the machine has a vibration that the sensor doesn't like or doesn't think it's the right vibration of the machine, all of these things. That is not the typical product that you would expect as part of the offering of a reinsurer. And maybe 2 or three years ago, you have said that is very unusual, to say the least. And I would like to talk to you -- with you about why is it a good idea for us to work on these topics, why is it a good idea for us to work on these topics. I'll pass it around. I promised Joachim who runs the team to give it back to him later today. So or maybe you manage that. When you look at the topics that we are involved with, they all center around 4 core external major trends. You will hear those trends over and over again today. Technology changes, new risks come up, we have new digital ecosystems and data analytics really are in a revolution. I would like to spend one moment on asking why do we work on these trends? For us, on the reinsurance side, that is not a top-down decision. There was not smart board meeting or a smart strategy, actually, where we said that's it. We it quite the other way around. We really start from many, many small initiatives throughout the organization, internal ideas, external ideas. Our whole innovation machine, we talked about this in the previous sessions that you may have heard, that our whole innovation machine with the scouts and the labs and all of that, that is all designed around nurturing and finding and triggering new ideas. Once we have the ideas, we then have a very lean process and a very efficient process because that's run by one of our managers to really invest and to nurture these innovation initiatives and to give them the corporate funding that they needed to make them grow. And if they succeed, they will get more funding. And if they don't succeed, they will -- we will stop them. And surprisingly, when you look at the initiatives that come up, all of those are in these major fields. So so far, we have not found a major trend that we would have said topdown, that's an important one, that was not -- been addressed by these initiatives from the ground up. And that is very good for us because we then have immediately people that are engaged in these topics. And we have colleagues that really want to take these topics to the next level. And that is the core reason why we are successful with our innovation initiatives. Of course, many of those topics have interactions and links. When you talk about IoT, you have to have data analytics. And we're going to look at cyber and the services that are around the cyber products. You need to have information about your exposures. You will add service components. You will work with digital ecosystems. So it's not a distinct set of initiatives. But now as we have the initiatives coming out in these different buckets, you can now start to link. And we learn from each other. And we get very good at connecting the different dots. You will hear more about cyber later today. You will hear more about IoT. You will hear much more about all the other system -- things, digital ecosystems, data analytics and so forth. Core message from my side, we do it more bottom-up rather than top-down. Of course, once they have a certain size, once they have a certain significance, we then start to also bring in top-down views and start to measure and to push them in the right direction. A few years ago, for us, insurance was more described as a fine-tuned machine, also on the reinsurance side. We started -- we tried to build up internal expertise. We brought capacities in-house to compete with other similar companies for known customer groups. That does not work anymore, at least not for us on the reinsurance side. We see that the customer bases are changing. We now work -- in addition to the cedents, we work with different customer groups, large corporates, small startups, digital ecosystems and the like. We see that competitors come out of unexpected areas. Again, startups but also large incumbents, large technology companies. And we see that it's -there's no way that we can really be fast enough and good enough in building up all the expertise in-house. That would be an ambition that is not achievable. So that's why we consciously decided let's more look into working in networks, let's design our processes in a way that we can bring in external partners. That can be tech startups. Tech startups, in many cases, help us to improve our own products. When it comes to IoT, for example, or to cyber, tech companies can help us. On the other way around, we can help them as well. We can take away some of the risks that are attached to their products. We can help them with distribution. Same is on the insure tech side, same game. We have digital ecosystems out there, vendors, brokers, digital MGAs, all of that. And they can help us to distribute our products. And we can help them to get around the red tape, if they want to get into new markets. We have large corporates. We can help them to innovate around a risk topics. And again, they can be important clients for as. And we have examples for all of these areas. And that only works in networks. If we try to build up all the cyber, AI technology, whatever expertise is out there, in-house, that will take a long time. And by the time we are finished, the developments would have moved on. And then the next round of startups and the next round of new ideas would have to be replaced. So we really believe in networks and partnerships work and a very different way, much more in a flexible and modular system rather than this fine-tuned machine on the reinsurance. Of course, it's a cultural change, the cultural shift. And one of the benefits that we see, because we have the labs, because we have the teams that go out to these labs for certain sprints, when they come back and do their day-to-day business, they also do that in a different way. We also see that when we set up the first rounds of scouts, we deliberately send out senior executives to Silicon Valley, experienced people to Tel Aviv. Because when they come back after 1 or 2 or three years, they help us to really change how we operate in the traditional business internally. So that cultural change really gets tangible now. So if you say we have the right topics, the question is, why us? Why are we in a good position to work on these innovation topics? You know about our global presence, our existing markets. You know about our global financial strength. We see more and more that it's a good positioning for us to have a full range of monetization options available. Irrespective of whether it's primary paper, technology, reinsurance paper, understanding about around risk topics, whatever, we have all the ingredients that you need to monetize most of the cases that we see out there. We have no IT legacy on the reinsurance side. We simply don't have enough clients and contracts per year in a reinsurance relationship to really mess up our systems over long time. It is all very lean. And we have invested a lot of money in the last 10 years to have global standards there. And that works very smoothly so there's no IT legacy. We have virtually no channel conflicts. We do have, at times, of course, topics where we have business units that cover similar areas. But these are only very few that really have these conflicting content. In most areas, we have no channel conflicts. So for startups, for incumbents that one to do new business, for large corporations that want to get into that space, we can offer swift solutions without stepping on the toes of our business units and other areas. When we went to the Silicon Valley, the question was, why would they -- in the first place, why would the startups, why would they -- would the innovation ecosystem even talk with us? Why would they be interested in? And we said, We don't know. We just test it. So we went there and realized that the innovation ecosystems out there, they are very interested in partnering with us because what they appreciate is our domain expertise in underwriting, in risk management, in claims and so forth. What the innovation companies - innovative companies, small and large, bring? Typically, it's technical expertise. What we bring is a thorough understanding of risks. What we also give is we have a very efficient access to new solutions. So when we have a good idea in one part of the world, take it cyber, one service component that is developed in one part and for one market, we can easily transfer it into other areas. We can also use our existing network, our existing distribution network on the reinsurance side to push new ideas globally. And that is much appreciated by most of the partners that we deal with. We have a strong brand. Trust is very important. It has been built up over the last years, significantly, also in this innovation system. And last. But not least, the longevity of our offerings. More and more seems to be a competitive advantage. We come across a number of startups or new ideas that then are acquired by another company. We had one prominent example last year that was an AI company that was bought by another company. And the day after they shut down their service. They said, That's in competition to what our new owners do. So we just stopped our service. And if you rely on new technologies, if you work with new things, that's, of course, the very thing that can happen to you. So what we offer in all what we do, we label. If it's a pilot, we said -- we tell our customers that is just a testing environment. And we test. But once it's up and running, they can rely on us providing that service in the pre-agreed framework, which is a very important asset to have in that space. Joachim mentioned we also do invest. That comes back to the question why companies talk to us in the Silicon Valley. The first round of discussions that we had internally was if you go to the Silicon Valley or Tel Aviv, you have to have a large checkbook. They said, if you don't offer a 3%, 4%, 5% participation in the startup company, they will not talk to us, they will not engage in -- because the only thing that they're interested in is money. And we found out that's not true. We found out that we can engage with companies, we can engage with partners and set up really cool new business models together. Then, once we like the development of these interactions, once like the projects, once we understand the business people and see that there is tangible value, then, we also negotiate and talk about a partnering in a financial way. Then we invest. And we did a few investments in our core areas of expertise with companies who we really have a working relationship that is already very close. So what does it mean for our overall setup? I hear many questions around is it reinsurance that we should focus on? Or is it innovation that we should focus on? What is better, reinsurance or innovation? People that ask me from the outside around this topic, usually, they say something like, Reinsurance is a shrinking business environment. So you now use innovation to do something new. Or they say the other way around, Reinsurance now, with all the losses and potential change in the cycle, that is now producing all the profits, do you still need the innovation at all? And that differentiation between our core business and innovation is fundamentally wrong. It's not about reinsurance or innovation. It's about reinsurance and special primary insurance that we do and innovation. The combination really is key for us. I fundamentally believe that the profit pool that have from the traditional reinsurance side, that they will stay because the world is getting riskier as we speak. At an individual level, at the level of commercial entities, at a regional level, at a global level, no matter where you look, we see more risks coming up. Some of them are driven by technology. Some of them are driven by political changes. Some of them are driven by the way how we work together globally and how we establish and define our production processes. So the world is getting more complex and more risky. And people want to transfer more risks to somebody else. We see more and more business cases where people start to say, I would like to get rid of a particular type of risk. So I fundamentally believe that traditional risk transfer components will stay. Traditional reinsurance is the core. And it will enormously benefit from the various innovation initiatives that we have. Because when you look at the risks like cyber, when you look at risks that come around -- come out of the new production processes around industrial IoT, when you look at the risks that are out there with the supply chains that get more and more automated and interconnected, that will be a good spot for us. And it will absolutely require us to be on the forefront of the innovation topics. Because if you don't really understand what's going on in cyber, if you don't really understand what's the industrial IoT does and if you don't really understand how these supply chains work, you will have a problem on the traditional side. And that's where many of our innovations really help us to grow and prosper in that area. We also help in many areas our cedents to set up their own innovation infrastructure. We have discussions around our experience with them setting up scouts and labs. We also diversify in a way that you don't have to set up your own labs and your own infrastructure. As an insurance company, you can get access to information that, for example, we provide an access to the ecosystem at large. But it's not just the traditional business, of course, that we focus on. There's a second very important part for us. And that is to create new strategic options out of this innovation space. You see on this slide that this -- that we, again, trying to group, same as Mark and Joachim, to share how we balance between the different areas and where we see the maturity and the distance of the core of the various options. All the things that you see on that slide are in place. So it's not just an idea. For all of them, at least to have solid pilot cases that have proven that we can do successful business in these areas. We talked about capital market solutions in the past. That, of course, is a core component. And it will help us with some of the growth that's closer to the core. That's not a core focus today. You will hear about the new digital platform in Canada and the digital partners when we talk about reshuffling the value chain, still being pretty close to the core insurance transactions. We then talk about expanding the boundaries of insurability. So we very successfully launched a pandemic steam. When I was on the underwriting side, 10, 15 years ago, pandemics was an absolute must exclusion. We just could not provide cover for pandemics. And now we have a team that tries to sell pandemics products. So that is really a transfer on how we deal with that risk. And that is possible because we have different ways of offloading the risk to the capital markets. And we have more expertise in assessing the risk because we partner with a startup company in California. Then we have the topics of cyber. And Daljitt Barn will talk about this in detail. Then we have more the real data-driven topics that are a bit further out, maybe try to monetize on our insights. I'm not so sure that this label of 'data is the new oil' is true in each and every case. In many areas, we can replace a certain set of data by just using another one. You can replace the traditional way of underwriting motor by looking at the driver score, maybe or other components. That's not perfect. But there is some replacement between the data. So the value of the data itself is not clear. That is -- it will be huge. But the insights derived out of this data, the ability to combine different sets of data and come up with new insights, that's the real value. And that's what we want to monetize in there. And of course, AI on the far out part. That is one of the core areas. And Wolfgang will talk about this in a moment. That's the brave new world where we really can have the machines supporting us significantly in what we do. So I hope that I got the message across, why it's a good idea for us to work on these topics. And I'm very much looking forward to having the discussion later on. Thank you. Wolf gang Hauner So we already heard a lot about data and Internet of Things and a lot of technology coming in. I want to give you some context why this is really important for us, why it matters. And why we need to work on it. So on the left-hand side, you see a large number. This is a 40 zetta, there's a number. And as a mathematician, I like numbers. 43 zetta, actually, is a projection of the overall data volume for the whole world in the year 2020. And we heard from Mark that 90% of the data was coming in the last two years. And that is mainly because machines are now talking to each other and producing a lot of data. In addition, we see new data types that get more relevant like pictures or videos, sometimes even the analysis of voice data is important. So we're getting much more data in. But not all of it is relevant. So it's really huge. But to find the relevant pieces, to get information out of the data is difficult. And here, new methods help us. And this was a topic about artificial intelligence that Marcus was already mentioning. So when we look back about 20 years, then the game of chess was over. And nobody would call this today artificial intelligence, because this was purely rule-based, the machine could simply calculate much faster than a human being. In 2011, that changed a little bit with IBM winning the Jeopardy! against a human. So we had some cognitive elements in there. It was not purely rule-based and last year, it was even the next level that the machine trained itself to win the game of Go. Google was very famous with that and you may have heard that recently, a few weeks ago, they were even beating themselves again with a newer version of this machine. And it was that much better that it had beaten the old machine 100 to 0. And this was just one year later. So there's a lot of development in the methodology area and we, as an insurance company, just want to make use of it. So that's this picture over here, where we use the functionality that gets produced by the Big Data companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and the open source community, where we have products like R and Python that we also use. We take that functionality. And enrich it with our insurance specific data, train it with that data. And by that, create insurance-specific functionality. And we can then use this functionality in all of our insurance processes. And we use it for our own purposes. So we want to make the work of all of our employees better. But of course we also want to provide it to our clients and provide them with services that have better quality and have faster delivery than we had before. To do this, it's very important to have the right people on board. So we are having data scientists, data engineers and the key is also to have them work together with the business experts. So only a data scientist would also not help, we need the business expertise to be partnered with the technical expertise. So data analytics is really vital for the whole group. We've heard that before. So we're using it within the group, of course, for the primary insurance in -- at ER for P&C life and particularly do data analytics and health. We use in the whole reinsurance group, centrally here in Munich. But also in the international organization, again in all lines of business. Here we put Hartford Steam Boiler up and particular in the IoT area, we will hear much more later from Greg Barats. And also we use it even in the asset management area, where we also use artificial intelligence already for the portfolio optimization. And most important, we use it for our clients. We want to generate a better business value and here it's about analyzing client portfolio data, identifying weak spots, helping them to find loss drivers and also to work on customer retention, reduce churn rates, that's the important project that we're doing with our clients. Where we do it? Basically, in all processes of the insurance or reinsurance value chain. Most important, is in the distribution area. Here it's mainly about those cases that we could not do economically useful in the past, because of high costs, here it's about low volume, high frequency cases where you can use machines to take over some parts that formerly humans had to do. And by that it's getting much cheaper to work on those cases and they get profitable. In underwriting, this is more about improving the workflow. But also improving the quality and the precision. So that's also a lot about understanding the risks better. And in claims, it's not about faster responses. And again, about more precision in the assessment of the claim and learning more and faster about how claims are evolving. And we have, also, in the afternoon, some examples on that. For example, The Box project, we will present you a little bit later in more detail. How it works in the reinsurance? To work on the data and analytics, it's a very simple process. So basically, it's 4 steps. The first one is pretty trivial. First, we have to collect the data. And here, it's our own Munich Re data that we've been collecting for many decades. But of course it's also data that we're receiving from our clients for further analysis and this is a growing area, we use much more external data sources, that means data from the Internet. But also data that we get from data aggregators for further analysis. Then it's key, really, to structure the data and store it and a vehicle we use here is our group wide data lake. So we put in the data, put all the metadata information in catalogs and that get transparency, which data do we have on which topics, who use this data before and even to an extent where we can see, which queries have been run on the data and how useful were they. The next type, then, is analyzing the data. Here it's about applying the right methods. So this is about machine learning, it's also a classical, statistical methodology that we're applying and then in the fourth step, it's, of course, action on the insights that we've been getting out of the analysis. So this is really then about improving efficiency, improving quality, for example, on the customer portfolio data and it's also on generating new business. So looking into more detail in the 4 steps, what you see on the right-hand side is our 2017 IT trend with a correlation map. So in the inner circle you see the main trends like digitalization, Internet of Things. And we're working heavily on all of these main trends and on the outer circle, you see related sub-trends. So these are more of these special topics. And we are also active, more or less, in all of these topics. Not in the same degree. So some we do more, some we do less. But we are doing basically, activities in all areas and here we are collecting the data. Then it's about structuring the data so for which purposes do we need it. So that could be geospatial data, it can be weather data, streaming data from sensors and we are adding our domain-specific expertise to these data areas. So this is really, then, bringing the actuarial science to this data, having the risk management people working on the data, we have supply chain experts, who then look at the data and try to make sense of it. The way we do it is, we bring the data into a central data lake. And here we have an open enterprise approach for the whole reinsurance group globally, that means every employee has access to this data lake, not so all the data. So we have different level of authorization in place. And here it's possible that the data gets shared. People can look into what data is available. By that we can enable very fast product typing, because you don't even have to start in the first step to looking for data and cleansing it and quality assuring the data, it's already there. So it's a very easy access. It's a self-service functionality and also, we have a lot of compute power in this data. Like it's not just about the data, it's also about having a lot of CPUs and a lot of storage available that people don't have to care about the technical piece of doing all this. And to structure it, it's technology layer that we're having at the beginning. So this needs to be there, then we bring the data in, we're adding logic centrally to the data. So this, for example, logic to bring data sources together to match keys of various data sources and make it a combined data source. And of course, it's also about having an easy user interface that the people can consume that data later on. And the technology we are using is various -- for various reasons. So the basis is a Hadoop cluster that allows us a very cost-efficient implementation, as this is open source. And it's very cheap storage in the first step. But sometimes you need high computation power, that's where we use SAP Hana, it's a very powerful in-memory technology. And we're using a SaaS high-performance analytics platform across the data lake and here we have a very close proximity between the data and the analytical functionality, where we can analyze all of the data in the data lake and again, this analytics platform is open to use for any employee in the reinsurance group. And by that, we're providing to our people the necessary analytics tools, very powerful tools. The access to the data and also very short time to make use of it. Finally, you have to use it. And that's why people get tools, for example, to visualize the data in the first step. So really to get a first overview like getting correlation maps, heat maps on the data. Then, if you got this first understanding of the data, it's about getting the meaning. So what is the importance of certain factors. For example, here we use classical statistical approaches like multivariable defect analysis. But also regression models and machine learning models to identify the important drivers within the data and of course, the goal is, in most cases to come up with predictive models, not just to look backwards but also to look in the future. And here, again, we're using the newest available methods and we have we have pretty well skilled people who are able to work with that. And that is all true for the structured data. As I said in the beginning, a lot of the data we're getting is unstructured. So we have a lot of text data, we have pictures, here we need different methods, again, machine learning and artificial intelligence helps a lot to get a meaning out of millions of text documents, for example. Or to identify damaged houses on pictures. So here it's really about bringing the new methods and making sense of it. How we do this? I have 2 examples here. Is, for example, in the area of digitally augmented underwriting. So not replacing the underwriter. But making certain steps that are currently pretty hard, easier. And also improving the quality at the same time. So here, for example, in the tariff calculation, traditionally you would use generalized linear models, GLNs, to calculate the tariff and this is very cumbersome. And needs a lot of expertise to do so. We are taking a different approach by using the client's portfolio data, adding Munich Re data, adding external data, by that, enhancing the data set so it's more information. But then you also need to come up with a new model. The old model doesn't fit anymore. And here the machine learning steps in. So we let the machine decide what is the optimal model in this case. And what are the real drivers in your portfolio, given that we added information. And that process we can do even automatically once we set it up once. And by that we can recalculate much faster. And that brings us more speed in the process and also it's bringing the costs down because we have less human interaction, we let the machine do the heavy lifting of the calculation. And also it's improving the quality. We're getting more insights on what really is driving the losses in a certain portfolio and use this for tariff calculation. A second example is to generate business. Here it's about cross-selling. And this example you can think of a little bit as an approach, like Amazon is doing when they're giving recommendations. So they say customers who bought this, also bought that. And here it's also about analyzing your own portfolio than identifying which people did actually buy one of your products and try to derive some reasons for it, then in the second step, you look again into the portfolio and try to identify those people who have the similar characteristics. But did not yet buy the product and then provide these subgroups with a probability and there's a score of buying propensity. And come up with a model that clusters your existing portfolio according to the likelihood that certain people will buy a new product that you offer. And you can see here, a result of such an exercise where we were geo-coding a portfolio of an insurance company, obviously in Germany. And here we were analyzing a certain product that people have bought. And came up with those scores and then visualize those. And as you can see in the most Western region there's a very highly likelihood that people will still need this product. And here, we can really improve transparency now for our clients. Where actually are these potentials? Where is a high probability to make us more efficient, have a better client relationship? We can actually also identify the right sales channel though, whether you call them, visit the client or do a mailing campaign, all that can be analyzed and optimized. And by that, we also help our cedents to grow their business and make better business decisions. With that, come to the end. And thank you very much for your attention.",   Thank you  Thank you tian for the nice introduction Good morning I brought something along for you This is a -grade sensor that was a design by one of our IoT teams p of 's team at HSB And you will hear more about what we do there later today And that sensor I will pass it around in a moment that measures things like temperature motion vibration You can attach it to a machine You can learn from the sensor if the machine runs hot You can learn from that sensor if the machine has a vibration that the sensor doesn't like or doesn't think it's the right vibration of the machine all of these things That is not the typical product that you would expect as p of the offering of a reinsurer And maybe  or three years ago you have said that is very unusual to say the least And I would like to talk to you -- with you about why is it a good idea for us to work on these topics why is it a good idea for us to work on these topics I'll pass it around I promised  who runs the team to give it back to him later today So or maybe you  that When you look at the topics that we are involved with they all center around  core external major trends You will hear those trends over and over again today Technology changes new s come up we have new digital ecosystems and data analytics really are in a revolution I would like to spend one moment on asking why do we work on these trends? For us on the re side that is not a top-down decision There was not sm board meeting or a sm  actually where we said that's it We it quite the other way around We really st from many many small initiatives throughout the organization internal ideas external ideas Our whole innovation machine we talked about this in the previous sessions that you may have heard that our whole innovation machine with the scouts and the labs and all of that that is all designed around nurturing and finding and triggering new ideas Once we have the ideas we then have a very lean process and a very efficient process because that's run by one of our s to really invest and to nurture these innovation initiatives and to give them the corporate funding that they needed to make them grow And if they succeed they will get more funding And if they don't succeed they will -- we will stop them And surprisingly when you look at the initiatives that come up all of those are in these major fields So so far we have not found a major trend that we would have said topdown that's an important one that was not -- been addressed by these initiatives from the ground up And that is very good for us because we then have immediately people that are engaged in these topics And we have colleagues that really want to take these topics to the next level And that is the core reason why we are successful with our innovation initiatives Of course many of those topics have interactions and links When you talk about IoT you have to have data analytics And we're going to look at cyber and the services that are around the cyber products You need to have information about your exposures You will add service coments You will work with digital ecosystems So it's not a distinct set of initiatives But now as we have the initiatives coming out in these different buckets you can now st to link And we learn from each other And we get very good at connecting the different dots You will hear more about cyber later today You will hear more about IoT You will hear much more about all the other system -- things digital ecosystems data analytics and so forth e message from my side we do it more -up rather than top-down Of course once they have a certain size once they have a certain significance we then st to also bring in top-down views and st to measure and to push them in the right direction A few years ago for us  was more described as a fine-tuned machine also on the re side We sted -- we tried to build up internal expertise We brought capacities in-house to compete with other similar companies for known customer s That does not work anymore at least not for us on the re side We see that the customer bases are changing We now work -- in addition to the cets we work with different customer s large corporates small stups digital ecosystems and the like We see that competitors come out of unexpected areas Again stups but also large incumbents large technology companies And we see that it's -there's no way that we can really be fast enough and good enough in building up all the expertise in-house That would be an ambition that is not achievable So that's why we consciously decided let's more look into working in networks let's design our processes in a way that we can bring in external pners That can be tech stups Tech stups in many cases help us to improve our own products When it comes to IoT for example or to cyber tech companies can help us On the other way around we can help them as well We can take away some of the s that are attached to their products We can help them with distribution Same is on the insure tech side same game We have digital ecosystems out there vendors brokers digital MGAs all of that And they can help us to distribute our products And we can help them to get around the red tape if they want to get into new markets We have large corporates We can help them to innovate around a  topics And again they can be important cnts for as And we have examples for all of these areas And that only works in networks If we try to build up all the cyber AI technology whatever expertise is out there in-house that will take a long time And by the time we are finished the developments would have moved on And then the next round of stups and the next round of new ideas would have to be replaced So we really beve in networks and s work and a very different way much more in a flexible and modular system rather than this fine-tuned machine on the re Of course it's a cultural change the cultural shift And one of the benefits that we see because we have the labs because we have the teams that go out to these labs for certain sprints when they come back and do their day-to-day  they also do that in a different way We also see that when we set up the first rounds of scouts we iberately send out senior s to Silicon Valley experienced people to Tel Aviv Because when they come back after  or  or three years they help us to really change how we operate in the traditional  internally So that cultural change really gets tangible now So if you say we have the right topics the question is why us? Why are we in a good position to work on these innovation topics? You know about our global presence our existing markets You know about our global financial strength We see more and more that it's a good positioning for us to have a full range of monetization options available Irrespective of whether it's primary paper technology re paper unstanding about around  topics whatever we have all the ingredients that you need to monetize most of the cases that we see out there We have no IT legacy on the re side We simply don't have enough cnts and contracts per year in a re relationship to really mess up our systems over long time It is all very lean And we have invested a lot of money in the last  years to have global standards there And that works very smoothly so there's no IT legacy We have virtually no channel conflicts We do have at times of course topics where we have  s that cover similar areas But these are only very few that really have these conflicting content In most areas we have no channel conflicts So for stups for incumbents that one to do new  for large corporations that want to get into that space we can offer swift solutions without stepping on the toes of our  s and other areas When we went to the Silicon Valley the question was why would they -- in the first place why would the stups why would they -- would the innovation ecosystem even talk with us? Why would they be interested in? And we said We don't know We just test it So we went there and realized that the innovation ecosystems out there they are very interested in pnering with us because what they appreciate is our domain expertise in unwriting in   in claims and so forth What the innovation companies - innovative companies small and large bring? Typically it's technical expertise What we bring is a thorough unstanding of s What we also give is we have a very efficient access to new solutions So when we have a good idea in one p of the world take it cyber one service coment that is developed in one p and for one market we can easily transfer it into other areas We can also use our existing network our existing distribution network on the re side to push new ideas globally And that is much appreciated by most of the pners that we deal with We have a strong brand Trust is very important It has been built up over the last years significantly also in this innovation system And last But not least the longevity of our offerings More and more seems to be a competitive adtage We come across a number of stups or new ideas that then are acquired by another company We had one prominent example last year that was an AI company that was bought by another company And the day after they shut down their service They said That's in competition to what our new owners do So we just stopped our service And if you rely on new technologies if you work with new things that's of course the very thing that can happen to you So what we offer in all what we do we label If it's a pilot we said -- we tell our customers that is just a testing environment And we test But once it's up and running they can rely on us providing that service in the pre-agreed framework which is a very important asset to have in that space  mentioned we also do invest That comes back to the question why companies talk to us in the Silicon Valley The first round of discussions that we had internally was if you go to the Silicon Valley or Tel Aviv you have to have a large checkbook They said if you don't offer a % % % picipation in the stup company they will not talk to us they will not engage in -- because the only thing that they're interested in is money And we found out that's not true We found out that we can engage with companies we can engage with pners and set up really cool new  mos together Then once we like the development of these interactions once like the projects once we unstand the  people and see that there is tangible value then we also negotiate and talk about a pnering in a financial way Then we invest And we did a few s in our core areas of expertise with companies who we really have a working relationship that is already very close So what does it mean for our overall setup? I hear many questions around is it re that we should focus on? Or is it innovation that we should focus on? What is better re or innovation? People that ask me from the outside around this topic usually they say something like Re is a shrinking  environment So you now use innovation to do something new Or they say the other way around Re now with all the losses and potential change in the cycle that is now producing all the profits do you still need the innovation at all? And that differentiation between our core  and innovation is fundamentally wrong It's not about re or innovation It's about re and special primary  that we do and innovation The combination really is key for us I fundamentally beve that the profit pool that have from the traditional re side that they will stay because the world is getting ier as we speak At an individual level at the level of  entities at a regional level at a global level no matter where you look we see more s coming up Some of them are driven by technology Some of them are driven by political changes Some of them are driven by the way how we work together globally and how we establish and define our production processes So the world is getting more complex and more y And people want to transfer more s to somebody else We see more and more  cases where people st to say I would like to get rid of a picular type of  So I fundamentally beve that traditional  transfer coments will stay Traditional re is the core And it will enormously benefit from the various innovation initiatives that we have Because when you look at the s like cyber when you look at s that come around -- come out of the new production processes around industrial IoT when you look at the s that are out there with the supply chains that get more and more automated and interconnected that will be a good spot for us And it will absolutely require us to be on the forefront of the innovation topics Because if you don't really unstand what's going on in cyber if you don't really unstand what's the industrial IoT does and if you don't really unstand how these supply chains work you will have a problem on the traditional side And that's where many of our innovations really help us to grow and prosper in that area We also help in many areas our cets to set up their own innovation infrastructure We have discussions around our experience with them setting up scouts and labs We also diversify in a way that you don't have to set up your own labs and your own infrastructure As an  company you can get access to information that for example we provide an access to the ecosystem at large But it's not just the traditional  of course that we focus on There's a second very important p for us And that is to create new strategic options out of this innovation space You see on this slide that this -- that we again trying to  same as  and  to share how we balance between the different areas and where we see the maturity and the distance of the core of the various options All the things that you see on that slide are in place So it's not just an idea For all of them at least to have solid pilot cases that have proven that we can do successful  in these areas We talked about capital market solutions in the past That of course is a core coment And it will help us with some of the growth that's closer to the core That's not a core focus today You will hear about the new digital platform in Canada and the digital pners when we talk about reshuffling the value chain still being pretty close to the core  transactions We then talk about expanding the boundaries of insurability So we very successfully launched a pandemic steam When I was on the unwriting side   years ago pandemics was an absolute must exclusion We just could not provide cover for pandemics And now we have a team that tries to sell pandemics products So that is really a transfer on how we deal with that  And that is possible because we have different ways of offloading the  to the capital markets And we have more expertise in assessing the  because we pner with a stup company in California Then we have the topics of cyber And   will talk about this in detail Then we have more the real data-driven topics that are a bit further out maybe try to monetize on our insights I'm not so sure that this label of 'data is the new oil' is true in each and every case In many areas we can replace a certain set of data by just using another one You can replace the traditional way of unwriting motor by looking at the driver score maybe or other coments That's not perfect But there is some replacement between the data So the value of the data itself is not clear That is -- it will be huge But the insights ived out of this data the ability to combine different sets of data and come up with new insights that's the real value And that's what we want to monetize in there And of course AI on the far out p That is one of the core areas And  will talk about this in a moment That's the brave new world where we really can have the machines supporting us significantly in what we do So I hope that I got the message across why it's a good idea for us to work on these topics And I'm very much looking forward to having the discussion later on Thank you Wolf gang  So we already heard a lot about data and Internet of Things and a lot of technology coming in I want to give you some context why this is really important for us why it matters And why we need to work on it So on the left-hand side you see a large number This is a  zetta there's a number And as a mathematician I like numbers  zetta actually is a projection of the overall

the whole re  globally that means every employee has access to this data lake not so all the data So we have different level of authorization in place And here it's possible that the data gets shared People can look into what data is available By that we can enable very fast product typing because you don't even have to st in the first step to looking for data and cleansing it and quality assuring the data it's already there So it's a very easy access It's a self-service functionality and also we have a lot of compute power in this data Like it's not just about the data it's also about having a lot of CPUs and a lot of storage available that people don't have to care about the technical piece of doing all this And to structure it it's technology layer that we're having at the beginning So this needs to be there then we bring the data in we're adding logic centrally to the data So this for example logic to bring data sources together to match keys of various data sources and make it a combined data source And of course it's also about having an easy user interface that the people can consume that data later on And the technology we are using is various -- for various reasons So the basis is a Hadoop cluster that allows us a very cost-efficient implementation as this is open source And it's very cheap storage in the first step But sometimes you need high computation power that's where we use SAP a it's a very powerful in-memory technology And we're using a SaaS high-performance analytics platform across the data lake and here we have a very close proximity between the data and the analytical functionality where we can analyze all of the data in the data lake and again this analytics platform is open to use for any employee in the re  And by that we're providing to our people the necessary analytics tools very powerful tools The access to the data and also very short time to make use of it Finally you have to use it And that's why people get tools for example to visualize the data in the first step So really to get a first overview like getting correlation maps heat maps on the data Then if you got this first unstanding of the data it's about getting the meaning So what is the importance of certain factors For example here we use classical statistical approaches like multivariable defect analysis But also regression mos and machine learning mos to itify the important drivers within the data and of course the goal is in most cases to come up with predictive mos not just to look backwards but also to look in the future And here again we're using the newest available methods and we have we have pretty well skilled people who are able to work with that And that is all true for the structured data As I said in the beginning a lot of the data we're getting is unstructured So we have a lot of text data we have pictures here we need different methods again machine learning and ificial intelligence helps a lot to get a meaning out of millions of text documents for example Or to itify damaged houses on pictures So here it's really about bringing the new methods and making sense of it How we do this? I have  examples here Is for example in the area of digitally augmented unwriting So not replacing the unwriter But making certain steps that are currently pretty hard easier And also improving the quality at the same time So here for example in the tariff calculation traditionally you would use generalized ar mos GLNs to calculate the tariff and this is very cumbersome And needs a lot of expertise to do so We are taking a different approach by using the cnt's portfolio data adding Munich Re data adding external data by that enhancing the data set so it's more information But then you also need to come up with a new mo The old mo doesn't fit anymore And here the machine learning steps in So we let the machine decide what is the optimal mo in this case And what are the real drivers in your portfolio given that we added information And that process we can do even automatically once we set it up once And by that we can recalculate much faster And that brings us more speed in the process and also it's bringing the costs down because we have less human interaction we let the machine do the heavy lifting of the calculation And also it's improving the quality We're getting more insights on what really is driving the losses in a certain portfolio and use this for tariff calculation A second example is to generate  Here it's about cross-selling And this example you can think of a little bit as an approach like Amazon is doing when they're giving recommendations So they say customers who bought this also bought that And here it's also about analyzing your own portfolio than itifying which people did actually buy one of your products and try to ive some reasons for it then in the second step you look again into the portfolio and try to itify those people who have the similar characteristics But did not yet buy the product and then provide these subs with a probability and there's a score of buying propensity And come up with a mo that clusters your existing portfolio according to the likelihood that certain people will buy a new product that you offer And you can see here a result of such an exercise where we were geo-coding a portfolio of an  company obviously in y And here we were analyzing a certain product that people have bought And came up with those scores and then visualize those And as you can see in the most tern region there's a very highly likelihood that people will still need this product And here we can really improve transparency now for our cnts Where actually are these potentials? Where is a high probability to make us more efficient have a better cnt relationship? We can actually also itify the right sales channel though whether you call them visit the cnt or do a mailing campaign all that can be analyzed and optimized And by that we also help our cets to grow their  and make better  decisions h that come to the end And thank you very much for your attention,introduction morning sensor design team p team today sensor moment thing temperature motion

I'm Martin Bride, Finance Director. So, what I would like to do is just spend a couple of minutes on a few of the finance KPIs and then to go through my usual trio of investments, reserve releases and capital. So on the finance KPIs, just a couple of points I'd like to draw out, the ones on the first slide. I'm very pleased with the net earned premium growth, 7%. So, that's a strong growth from my perspective. In particular, our U.S. business started growing strongly in the second half of 2013 and particularly, that aspect of the business is now flowing through the earned premium line. So, that's a good outcome from the team. The other highlight for me here, I mean there is a helping FX effect, but the NTA per share, shareholders have £1.35 this time last year. They received a £0.212 in dividends and they've now got £1.566 in the company. So, that's a big increase in NTA over a 12-month period which is testament to the achievement of the teams at Beazley. So, on the investment front, remarkably a similar picture to 2014. We've achieved 1% in the six months, so an annualized 2% return, and it's pretty much business as usually. If you look at our portfolio, we remain with a core portfolio, 85% of it conservatively invested and generating, given the very low interest rate environment except for returns. And then we have about 15% seeking slightly higher yield in what we call our capital growth asset portfolio. We are in the process of implementing a few minor changes within that portfolio, and you can see between December and June a slight evolution in the weightings there. But overall, it's a very consistent strategy and we're pleased with the way it's performed in the first half of the year. We, nevertheless, continue with very low U.S. interest rates and are hoping at some point that that perspective changes and rates actually go up which is – be great for the economics of our business, although it will create some investment losses as and when it happens. Moving on to the claims reserve picture. Reserving is a key part of Beazley results presentation. Our philosophy as a company is always to reserve prudently across all our lines of business. And therefore, on average, you should expect to seek reserve releases coming from the claim reserves as they are paid out, and that is the case in the first half of 2015. You can see it's very much in line with our long-term average coming from most divisions of the company are contributing to that reserve release picture, so we're very encouraged with that. And just as important as the releases that have been made in the half year is the question of is that likely to continue, and that's why we show you this graph, which is giving you an indication of how we view the strength of the reserves that remain on our balance sheet. As you can see, we are in the corridor that we're targeting. The graph is relatively sensitive, so I don't get too excited by minor movements in it. I think the big picture takeaway for me is that the reserve strength of the reserves in our balance sheet remains consistent within the corridor that we've targeted. And therefore, all other things being equal, those reserve releases that you see coming through our P&L are sustainable and should continue as we go forward. Finally, an update on our capital position. We have a strong capital position. The board saw fit to declare an interim dividend of £0.033. That's an increase of just over 6% over the same time last year. The philosophy of Beazley is to review capital positions at the year end, once we have a clear view of the business plan for the next 12 months and the fullyear results. So, we're very pleased with the strong capital position we have at the half year, and that will be reviewed towards the end of the year. So Mike, over to you.",   Thank you Thank you w Good morning everyone I'm   Finance  So what I would like to do is just spend a couple of minutes on a few of the  KPIs and then to go through my usual

And it's great to be here as well. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Chris Schaper. I'm the CEO of AIG Re. I thought I give you a little background on AIG Re for those that are not very familiar with the Company, the organization itself. First off, we started in mid 2019 and the Company is up as comprised of companies that were within the Validus Group. And for those that -- to give a little bit background on Validus, Validus had both insurance and reinsurance operations as part of it. The reinsurance businesses were segmented off and are now part of AIG Re. In particular, they encompass three enterprises, Validus -- sorry, I apologize, Validus Re is one of the entities in AIG Re. So Validus Re itself is a traditional reinsurer and deploys capital through its balance sheet as a traditional reinsurance would. Talbot Treaty is another enterprise that is part of AIG Re. It was part of Validus Re when the acquisition occurred as well. Talbot Treaty is part of Talbot Syndicate. And Talbot Syndicate in essence deploys capital through a Lloyd's syndicate approach. And then there is AlphaCat. And AlphaCat is an asset manager that operates in the reinsurance space and it has roughly about $4 billion of assets under management. So those three enterprises were part of the Validus Group initially and now would make up AIG Re. It certainly been a very busy year for the team. COVID-19 has continued impact in the reinsurance market quite substantially. And in particular beyond that, it's also been a very active storm season for 2020. And so from a frequency point of view, as you know, we got into the Greek alphabet for the various storms that took place in 2020. Prior to that, certainly the last few years were very active as well from a storm point of view. So twin COVID and the active storm season and other issues associated within the reinsurance market, it's become a very dynamic environment. What we're seeing in the market right now is that positive pricing is certainly taking place in almost every line. Still early on for more terms and signings, but those are being worked through as we speak. That's been very active capital flow in the reinsurance space. You may have seen significant new scale ups or new start-ups for both traditional reinsurance as well as for alternative capital entities. But overall makes really interesting time for those of us in the reinsurance space and of itself. That being said, just a few other comments that this is not 2002 or 2006. We're -- at that point in existing markets, we're frankly scrambling to engage. This is very different. This is an incumbent market. Existing entities with strong balance sheets, with strong client-broker relationships, with strong bench strength, with strong operations, et cetera, are definitely there to take on this particular market, which again is different from where things were previously. And those enterprises frankly are the ones that have a very strong position for success. Our clients right now prefer certainly markets that are very active, there they seek to -that seek to offer quotes out to the market and seek to deploy their capital effectively and seek to properly engage kind of across the board within the spectrum of reinsurance. And so, again, we're seeing some very -- it's very active time period right now, but again, those enterprises that have all of those underlying components that I just mentioned are very, very good shape to actually execute. I'm sure we'll talk about the reinsurance market overall, but those are just a few opening comments and I'll turn it back over to you, Brian.

1599,Martin Coriat,20140305_Admiral_Group_PLC-_Earnings_Call_2014-3-5_SD000000002736695151.pdf,2014-03-05,187.0,1,0,Admiral Group," 20266744  Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. I'm very happy to be here today. Since the end of last year, I'm the Confused.com CEO, but I joined the Admiral Group about six years ago. In the last six years, I launched and managed the French aggregator business. To start with, I would like to discuss the current price insurance cycle, and present how price has evolved over the last few years. It's an interesting starting point to discuss what's around the corner in terms of price insurance cycle. However, working in a price comparison business, I'd like to adopt the price comparison view of this cycle, before letting David discuss the more insurer view of it. So what happened in terms of price evolution in the last six years? As you can see here, from the Confused.com price index, premium experienced a massive increase in the first few years, between 2008 and 2010, picking up 38% increase in 2010. In the last couple of years, you will not be surprised to see the new business rate falling dramatically. Prices have actually fallen by 13% in 2012, and an additional 13% in 2013. Great news for customers, isn't it? But overall, the cycle is clearly shaped, and reminds us how much the insurance business is cyclical, with very abrupt ups and downs. I know there are quite a few indexes out there, and that's we've come up with this slide. It might be a bit confusing for you all, the different indexes, and that's why Confused.com is proudly presenting to you today a fair comparison of the different price insurance indexes. In a nutshell, as you can see here, they're all relevant, but address the car insurance prices question a bit differently. Confused.com takes only new businesses prices into account, when ABI is across new business and renewal. Confused and ABI are both based on a very large volume of data, whilst the AA index comes from a much smaller sample. The other main difference between these indexes is the length of service, as some indexes started to be published a long time ago, while others are more recent. So it's not surprising that they all come up with different figures on a quarterly basis; they use a different methodology. But they all clearly indicate the same downward trend for the entire year, 2013, as you can see. It's up to you to decide which one we want to take into account. As far as I'm concerned, the choice is clear; I'm a Confused.com price index fan, but I might be a bit biased. In this environment, what are Confused.com's results in 2013? Confused made a very good year, and we're very pleased with this strong set of results. First and foremost, profit is up year on year, as well as revenue, which, in the aggregator business, is synonym of good and growing business. Second, we continue to make progress on a lot of operational fronts, including traffic acquisition; getting more customers on the Confused.com website. To give you one example, Confused enjoyed a number one position on natural search on Google for the main product in 2013. Last, but not least, Confused proved its innovation capabilities by launching QuickQuote and offering new experience to customers. In case you do not know QuickQuote, it's a user-friendly and very rapid quote process that allows Confused.com registered users to get quotes in seconds. Our plans for the future remain very ambitious. First one, to grow our market share in an ever maturing market; we want to promote new products and new innovation in order to be less reliant on car insurance. And finally, continue to install our new brand identity, Brian the Robot, in consumer minds. Overall, 2013 was a very good year for Confused. We're very pleased with the results. 20% profit increase is a fantastic result in a competitive environment, and we know that the car insurance aggregation is a very competitive environment. So we'll see what the future has in store for Confused. But if we step back and add up a market view of the price comparison, it's still a very good market to be in. You can see on this slide the rate of price comparison adoption over the years, and is a clear message; whatever is the evolution of the prices, whatever prices are going up and down, price comparison continue to flourish. Consumers are definitely embracing it more and more. They're embracing it for car insurance, now being used on that front, and we can see from the charts an annual growth rate at 19% over the last six years. The market is slowly maturing, and we can expect a phase of more limited in growth in the future. But it is also embracing it for other products as well, such as home insurance; a product that grew 16% year on year in 2013. So these other products are, clearly, the future growth drivers for Confused. That was the vision from a price comparison perspective, and I will now hand over to David for the insurers' view of the cycle.",   Thank you  Good morning everyone I'm very happy to be here today Since the end of last year I'm the Confusedcom  but I joined the Admiral  about six years ago In the last six years I launched and d the French aggregator  To st with I would like to discuss the current pe  cycle and present how pe has evolved over the last few years It's an interesting sting point to discuss what's around the corner in terms of pe  cycle However working in a pe comparison  I'd like to adopt the pe comparison view of this cycle before letting  discuss the more insurer view of it So what happened in terms of pe evolution in the last six years?

Because I understand that the financial impact of this program is of the utmost importance. And that's why I'd like to leave the floor to Herr Jurecka and Herr Schneider by this point in time. Let me basically tell you where I believe ER is starting from. I think you are all very much aware of the industry changes that we have. And I don't want to allude to them. But based on these industry changes, I believe that ER has a good starting position. We have quite a significant position in Germany. We have market-leading position in health and in legal protection. We are well-positioned in P&C. We have challenges in life, because of the closure of the classical book. And I will refer to that in a minute. In addition to the German footprint, which we are very well known for, we also have a significant international presence in over 30 countries, with top 10 positions in a couple of significant countries. And obviously being part of Munich Re gives us access to know-how, capital. And an innovative-oriented group. Now one of the questions I often get is, what are my key findings. And you will find them on page number 4. I believe it's fair to say that ER has a track record of a disappointing development of top and bottom line, in this way lagging behind expectations. Their cost structures are clearly above the market. On the infrastructure and digitalization side, we have to see the effect in the eye that we need more reliable IT platforms to run the business efficiently. And also to accomplish the digital transformation, which will become increasingly more important in the way that the market is digitizing itself. And that's why currently I have to come to the assessment that the opportunities of digitalizations are not yet fully realized. On the product side, it's very important to master this challenge, to have modular product concepts, which we currently have not yet fully integrated into our offering. And also on the life side, we need a convincing new strategy for new pension products with a basically stronger focus on financial products. And thus the realization of synergies with MEAG, our asset management company. Lastly, I believe that given the fact that we have now embarked on a route to close the classical business more or less entirely, the organizational separation of the traditional life back book and new business is in order. Thus on page 5, the key aspects of our strategic measures are that we would like to achieve a situation in which we strengthen the role of being a leading primary insurer with a strong domestic market, by really creating a comprehensive offering of products, advice services across all distribution channels. And I cannot emphasize this enough that we really want the cost channel approach here. And we also are determined to transform our business model digitally. We want to create promoters out of our customers, people who refer to us actively. We want to become a modern and attractive partner for our employees and sales partners. And we commit to maintain a sustainable contribution to Munich Re results of EUR500 million and more, starting 2021 at the latest. We will need will EUR1 billion of investments. And the figures here are net figures that I refer to. We will invest this EUR1 billion until 2021. This will translate into EUR280 million of net cost savings. And given the fact that a lot of our competitors always use gross figures in this regard, we also translated them for you in EUR540 million gross figure. And again, this translates into the EUR500 million net profit as of 2021 onwards. On page seven you see sort of the general architecture of the program. And it falls into three categories. We want to be fit. We want to be digital. And we want to be successful. And the general idea is on the fit category that we want to create a lean structure. And an effective (governance). On digital, we want to create the basis for the change of the business model transformation into a digital age. On the successful side, we want to have convincing solutions for all of our customer segments. The EUR1 billion that we invest, a little shy of 40% go into the fit category, a little more than 40% go into the digital category. And 20% go into the successful category, which shows you that this program is quite balanced with regards to all of the pillars that it addresses. I will now in the remaining 10 minutes very briefly touch on the most important of these 13 separately run initiatives, which however will all be tying into the picture that will ultimately create the new ER. One of the major changes that we undertake and with that I am on the following page, number 8. We will basically have to improve the effectiveness of our sales organization. And with our previous strategies, we have almost semi-integrated the five sales distribution agency channels into one. But it's really only semi-integrated. So we put them into one legal entity framework. But process-wise, they still operate quite independently. With this move, we will now really conclude the creation of one ER. And transform those five agency channels into one ER agency channel. In the same context, we will retain the regional presence and the customer proximity. But because of overlapping structures that gives us efficiency gains of 54 regional directions, which basically means we (restore) from 18 locations. And I could say in bracket, only. Because the rest is just a redundancy figure. And realistically this gives us a much more efficient structure than we currently have. In addition to that, in order to be more successful on the sales side, we would like to take the broker distribution out of the agency distribution management. And position that with what we call the product provider that is the risk takers of P&C and life. On the administration side, on page number 9, we basically just have the goal of even further lean and efficient processes and structures. And given my assessment that I believe our costs are too high and I think that can be easily demonstrated when we do competitor comparisons, we believe we just have to become more efficient. I spare you the process on how we dealt with this. But after the end of the program, we are very wellpositioned amongst our peer group of our competitors. And we will then basically have cost structures which we believe are medium-term sustainable in order to future grow. Page number 10 refers to your third work stream, which is the international organization, in which we have basically only now decided two things. The first thing is that we changed the governance model. And basically moved the regional management out of Dusseldorf into the regions, which I believe is a more modern approach. And obviously we are then closer to our businesses. And we use this to establish an even more thorough governance of our Group CFO, who will comment on that when he has basically the floor in a couple of minutes. In addition to this governance change, we come up with a cost savings program in the order of magnitude of EUR30 million, which basically gives us the confidence that we also become more financially efficient in the international organization. Work stream number four is with German life and the separation of the traditional life business from the new life business. As you are very well aware, ER already announced the exit from traditional life business with regards to its new sales. Following this decision, organizational changes, namely the separation of the traditional back book and new business, will now be implemented. We have the concentration of our future product strategy, which is a capital market related and biometric product range through our risk carrier, ER VORSORGE, which for those of you who know us on a detailed level, will have to be renamed into ER VORSORGE. Because currently it's just called VORSORGE. We will then secondly establish an effective and separate organization and entities with optimized processes for the traditional life business, which basically means the legal entities ER Leben and Victoria Leben. And ER Pensionskasse will be closed for new business. New business will now be only generated from portfolio due to legal or contractual obligation. A new setup will basically retain or give us significant management advantages, including a higher financial transparency. Page number 12 gives you a little more detail on this, where you basically see what I've just alluded to in graphics. I think this is something which I can jump over now. Work stream number five and work stream number six deal with IT. And they both basically say in a nutshell that we are going to fundamentally renovate all of our IT. It's going to be a very big task, which we very diligently are going to manage. And it will basically start to come to bear fruit when we try to come up with more standardized software in our classical basis IT, with new testing methods, just basically to become more state-of-the-art in our basic foundational IT. Based on these developments, which will take place in the next 18 to 24 months at least lying the groundwork for this, we will also in parallel grow a more digital and more agile IT structure. So for example on the digital IT, we will come up and build in cooperation with leading digital companies who will then come up with digital labs that we will jointly either own or operate, in order to retain a flexible IT digital infrastructure. And that should help us to have a much faster reaction time. And these will be the two key infrastructure ingredients in order to become very prepared for the business digital transformation. And let me just basically point out that once this program is over, it is our ambition to have real state-of-the-art IT throughout the entire value chain. And it's very obvious to me that once this is completed, we will be able to achieve more growth opportunities. And to basically take new client groups in an order of magnitude that is not yet fully reflected in the plans that we currently have. But it's too early to say on a serious level what kind of direction this will take. Because we first have to do our homework before we contemplate that more seriously. And I would like to point out that we can transform the fact that we are now at a point in the investment cycle in which we now have to fundamentally invest into IT. We can transform that into an opportunity, which will be the basis for many more growth initiatives going forward. We will work, on page number 15 and work stream number seven, in terms of automating and stabilizing our processes. That's something I'd like to flip over. Because it's really some sort of homework. So with that, I would like to move to the third pillar, which is being successful. And this itself falls into three categories. Work stream eight is basically digitization of the product portfolio. We already have a very good basis for this product portfolio. Because we are quite successful in various areas of our business. We can, however, even accelerate this level of success if we truly digitized that. That means that we will develop products exclusively for the internet age. And for the digitized age, which will then-- and that is quite an often misunderstanding-- not only be available digitally. But these products are also able to be sold offline via sales agents, because the client behavior is changing. And they don't want these complicated products anymore. And we can also use this as an opportunity which will cross-fertilize into the classical offline sales, which is another growth opportunity. Also-- and I would like to restress that, because it's such an important synergy-- we would like to embrace the opportunities that we have with MEAG. Because the asset management competence of our asset manager is not yet fully reflected in our product range, first and foremost on the old-age provisioning product offering. That's why I believe that it will be another very important way forwards. Modularization and providing a (pricely) attractive basis product, which will then be augmented by various modules; that is another strategy which you are very well aware of from the market. And obviously we will adopt that as well. We will then, once we have-- and we start now-- once we have a more modern, more digitalized product range, we will then go into client segments. The first client segment I believe it's the most important one, is the hybrid customer. Just for reference purposes, the hybrid customer and the way we look at it is the customer who seamlessly wants to be integrated between sales agents, internet approaches, call centers, et cetera. That obviously requires significant investments, not only in the IT, which I've already alluded to in work stream number five and six, which again cross-fertilizes this opportunity. Because it gives an opportunity for us that once we are investing into these kind of new ITs, we can already have the product offering for the hybrid customer in mind. So these customers really do not fall into the category either sales agent or internet. They really do both. And that is a very much growing segment. And we are very well-positioned. Because in order to succeed in that market, you need one, regional salesforces. Because these people do really want sometime a human interaction. And here we have a very large sales organization in the future even more efficiently run. And secondly, they need a convincing direct presence. And with ER Direkt, we have as you know, one of the most successful direct players in our group. So a combination of the growing segment, the regional sales, ER Direkt in our group, plus the IT investments, I think, gives us sort of a pole position to take advantage of this market trend. And that's why I believe this will be a very important growth opportunity. And I would also like to say that this is something which also carries further beyond 2021. And will give us further growth opportunities over and above the current planning going forward. In addition to those hybrid customers, there is a group of pure online customers. And the way I like to define that is that pure online customers differentiate themselves from hybrid customers that they are pure online only. This is a smaller segment. But it's something that we don't cover as ER. And in some areas, it has a significant market share, not that much. But still significant. So 5% to 10% of the new motor market, in my judgment, is easily be found in this category. And I would like to take advantage of that as well. That's why as of 2017, we plan to establish a pure direct player, no telephony, no sales agents, just internet approaches, very lean, very price competitive, very efficient processes; however, very customer-oriented for this target group. We will do sort of a network approach. And try to collaborate with other providers that can be startups, that can be IT platforms, that can be other providers. We will try to partner with them, come up with an efficient platform. And use a new brand and put that in the marketplace first with a motor product in (2017). And we then plan to expand that both in terms of product range and diversify internationally as soon as 2018, if everything works out as we plan currently. I will then very briefly only touch on work stream number 11, the industrial and commercial business. That's basically business as usual, just taking advantage of the competencies that we have on a more international area. On number 12, ER Mobility Solutions, is something which we will use to increase our initiatives in the B2B2C segment. You are all very well aware that B2B2C is a growing segment. And we have been lucky enough to hire somebody who has a very good set of experience in the B2B2C automotive segment, is Karsten Crede. He will lead that. And I think, given his personal background plus the market (opportunity) plus the experiences that we already have in ER in this context, will give us a very strong position. Like with the hybrid customer and the pure online customer, I believe there is growth opportunities in this area, which gives even more (fantasy) compared to what we have already put in the plan. But it's too early to tell. Because Herr Crede will only join us on the 1st of January. But again, in these plans we lay the foundation for further growth in this regard. Last but not least before I hand over to Herr Jurecka, the international expansion will be revisiting in H2 2016. As you see, we have-- as you have seen, as we have just announced that we now a stake in the Thai operation. I would still like to say for the moment we focus on the operations that we have. And try to improve their profitability and the way going forward. We will obviously commit anyway to selectively grow our portfolio, especially in Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, if and when opportunities arise. But our main focus for the moment is to invest and improve the current operations, which we already have, as I said, the significant franchise in. And however, we have currently focused primarily on the domestic part of the business. And the international part of the business will then be revisited between now and November. So you can expect a new strategy statement in this regard by the end of 2016. That was my brief 20-minute run through the strategic context. And I will now transfer to Christoph Jurecka, who will tell you something more about the financials. Thank you.",   Thank you very much Good day I will  myself to  minutes Because I unstand that the financial impact of this program is of the utmost importance And that's why I'd like to leave the floor to Herr  and Herr Schnei by this point in time Let me basically tell you where I beve ER is sting from I think you are all very much aware of the industry changes that we have And I don't want to allude to them But based on these industry changes I beve that ER has a good sting position We have quite a significant position in y We have market-leading position in health and in legal protection We are well-positioned in P&C We have challenges in life because of the closure of the classical book And I will refer to that in a minute In addition to the  footprint which we are very well known for we also have a significant international presence in over  countries with top  positions in a couple of significant countries And obviously being p of Munich Re gives us access to know-how capital And an innovative-oriented  Now one of the questions I often get is what are my key findings And you will find them on page number  I beve it's fair to say that ER has a track record of a disappointing development of top and   in this way lagging behind expectations Their cost structures are clearly above the market On the infrastructure and digitalization side we have to see the effect in the eye that we need more reliable IT platforms to run the  efficiently And also to accomplish the digital transformation which will become increasingly more important in the way that the market is digitizing itself And that's why currently I have to come to the assessment that the opporties of digitalizations are not yet fully realized On the product side it's very important to master this challenge to have modular product concepts which we currently have not yet fully integrated into our offering And also on the life side we need a convincing new  for new pension products with a basically stronger focus on financial products And thus the realization of synergies with MEAG our asset  company Lastly I beve that given the fact that we have now embarked on a route to close the classical  more or less entirely the organizational separation of the traditional life back book and new  is in or Thus on page  the key aspects of our strategic measures are that we would like to achieve a situation in which we strengthen the role of being a leading primary insurer with a strong domestic market by really creating a comprehensive offering of products advice services across all distribution channels And I cannot emphasize this enough that we really want the cost channel approach here And we also are determined to transform our  mo digitally We want to create promoters out of our customers people who refer to us actively We want to become a mon and attractive pner for our employees and sales pners And we commit to maintain a sustainable contribution to Munich Re results of EUR million and more sting  at the latest We will need will EUR billion of s And the figures here are net figures that I refer to We will invest this EUR billion until  This will translate into EUR million of net cost savings And given the fact that a lot of our competitors always use gross figures in this regard we also translated them for you in EUR million gross figure And again this translates into the EUR million net profit as of  onwards On page seven you see sort of the general architecture of the program And it falls into three categories We want to be fit We want to be digital And we want to be successful And the general idea is on the fit category that we want to create a lean structure And an effective governance On digital we want to create the basis for the change of the  mo transformation into a digital age On the successful side we want to have convincing solutions for all of our customer segments The EUR billion that we invest a little shy of % go into the fit category a little more than % go into the digital category And % go into the successful category which shows you that this program is quite balanced with regards to all of the pillars that it addresses I will now in the remaining  minutes very briefly touch on the most important of these  separately run initiatives which however will all be tying into the picture that will ultimately create the new ER One of the major changes that we untake and with that I am on the following page number  We will basically have to improve the effectiveness of our sales organization And with our previous strategies we have almost semi-integrated the five sales distribution agency channels into one But it's really only semi-integrated So we put them into one legal entity framework But process-wise they still operate quite indepently h this move we will now really conclude the creation of one ER And transform those five agency channels into one ER agency channel In the same context we will retain the regional presence and the customer proximity But because of overlapping structures that gives us efficiency gains of  regional directions which basically means we restore from  locations And I could say in bracket only Because the rest is just a redundancy figure And realistically this gives us a much more efficient structure than we currently have In addition to that in or to be more successful on the sales side we would like to take the broker distribution out of the agency distribution  And position that with what we call the product provi that is the  takers of P&C and life On the administration side on page number  we basically just have the goal of even further lean and efficient processes and structures And given my assessment that I beve our costs are too high and I think that can be easily demonstrated when we do competitor comparisons we beve we just have to become more efficient I spare you the process on how we dealt with this But after the end of the program we are very wellpositioned amongst our peer  of our competitors And we will then basically have cost structures which we beve are medium-term sustainable in or to future grow Page number

the regional  out of Dusseldorf into the regions which I beve is a more mon approach And obviously we are then closer to our es And we use this to establish an even more thorough governance of our  CFO who will comment on that when he has basically the floor in a couple of minutes In addition to this governance change we come up with a cost savings program in the or of magnitude of EUR million which basically gives us the confice that we also become more financially efficient in the international organization Work stream number four is with  life and the separation of the traditional life  from the new life  As you are very well aware ER already announced the exit from traditional life  with regards to its new sales Following this decision organizational changes namely the separation of the traditional back book and new  will now be implemented We have the concentration of our future product  which is a capital market related and biomet product range through our  carrier ER VORSORGE

you a little more detail on this where you basically see what I've just alluded to in graphics I think this is something which I can jump over now Work stream number five and work stream number six deal with IT And they both basically say in a nutshell that we are going to fundamentally renovate all of our IT It's going to be a very big task which we very diligently are going to  And it will

market in my judgment is easily be found in this category And I would like to take adtage of that as well That's why as of  we plan to establish a pure direct player no telephony no sales agents just internet approaches very lean very pe competitive very efficient processes; however very customer-oriented for this target  We will do sort of a network approach And try to collaborate with other provis that can be stups that can be IT platforms that can be other provis We will try to pner with them come up with an efficient platform And use a new brand and put that in the marketplace first with a motor product in  And we then plan to expand that both in terms of product range and diversify internationally as soon as  if everything works out as we plan currently I will then very briefly only touch on work stream number  the industrial and   That's basically  as usual just taking adtage of the competencies that we have on a more international area On number  ER Mobility  is something which we will use to increase our initiatives in the BBC segment You are all very well aware that BBC is a growing segment And we have been lucky enough to hire somebody who has a very good set of

give us a very strong position Like with the hybrid customer and the pure on customer I beve there is growth opporties in this area which gives even more fantasy compared to what we have already put
