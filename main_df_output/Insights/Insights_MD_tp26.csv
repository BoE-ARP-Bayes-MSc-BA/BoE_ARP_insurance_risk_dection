I'm Simon Thomas, CFO of Just Retirement, and I'd like to welcome you all to this conference call to discuss our IMS for the three months ended 30 of September, 2014. We really do appreciate your interest. And I'm joined on the line by Shayne Deighton, our Chief Actuary, and David Cooper, our Director of Marketing and Distribution. I'll talk briefly about our first quarter's trading statement and then we'll have some time for your questions. Please do remember that we have a June year-end, so the first quarter of our 2014/2015 financial year, which is under discussion now, represents the third quarter of the calendar year. So, first, we're today reporting a 42% fall in total sales, driven by a 48% fall in total annuity sales and a 23% fall in lifetime mortgages. Total annuity sales would have only been 26% lower if they had included the £75 million DB scheme we told you about a couple of weeks ago. This was signed in September and closed in October, making it a Q2 event. The 48% fall in total annuity volumes reflects the net effect of very different conditions experienced by our individual business compared to our DB de-risking business. DB continued to grow strongly. Sales were up roughly sevenfold compared to the equivalent prior-year quarter to £24.8 million, obviously excluding the £75 million sale announced in October. If that scheme had been written a week earlier, then we would have written more DB business in Q1 than in the whole of the previous year. We're are also pleased to be able to announce that we signed contracts on another large DB scheme for £76 million, which is due to complete later this week. Base effects means DB growth rates will start to look more normal as the year progresses, but the business remains inherently lumpy and will continue to be volatile in shape. Trustees meet infrequently and the business is made up of a small number of relatively large transactions, so this lumpiness won't go away. But out of the total £1.8 trillion of DB scheme liabilities in the market, there are over £600 billion of pensions in payment for us to target. Even if only a small percentage can benefit from our medical underwriting each year, this provides a strong growth potential. Many years of ALM work has reduced the volatility of the capital position of most DB schemes. This has improved the consistency of trustee demand, but not to the point that it will grow in a nice straight line. The IUA picture is more challenging, as we continue to come to terms with the budget's aftermath. IUA sales were 59% lower than in the equivalent quarter of our previous financial year. They fell by 55%, if we compare them to the first calendar quarter of this year, which was the last to be unaffected by the budget. So it's difficult to portray this as anything other than a tough quarter for IUA volumes, albeit not as bad as the 90% drops some had predicted. We believe that for customers with less than £100,000 to work with, guaranteed lifetime income will continue to be a key part of their post-retirement financial planning, and our medical underwriting skills mean we can offer many of them a better income. We managed mortgage volumes down by 23% in the quarter, against a tide of good market growth. Including the large DB sale which ended up being booked in Q2, the fall in lifetime mortgage sales was broadly in line with the drop in annuity sales. The mortgages continue to offer a great match to our liabilities, especially DB, which tends to bring longer duration cash flows. As of today, trading conditions for IUAs have continued in the current quarter in line with our Q1 run rate. But, as we've flagged in several places, there is a risk of further volatility ahead of the new rules in April. So, even though DB volumes have exceeded our expectations so far, we are limiting ourselves to saying that we remain confident in achieving our overall full-year sales expectations, rather than talking prospects up. Obviously, we'll update you as the year progresses, but I think you can understand the huge uncertainties we face in the current sales environment. Now, before we move on to Q&A, I want to pre-empt the inevitable questions about the new products we'll be launching once the rules change in April. In addition to the core retirement income proposition, we'll also offer a product allowing customers to leave some of their assets invested, whilst converting most of their retirement funds into a guaranteed income for life. It's key to remember that our average case size is around £60,000, which often means our mass market customers really do need the additional income which a guaranteed income solution offers, rather than relying on the state pension. At this level, few financial advisors consider it prudent or economic to do the work required to put them into drawdown, given the relatively small sums involved by drawdown standards. Please don't forget this when you write about it. For our individual customers, inheritance tax and often even income tax are simply not an issue once they retire, but enhancing the state pension with the best value guaranteed income solution they can get in order to pay their bills is. That's why we remain confident that our individual retirement income offering will remain relevant into the future. Our medical underwriting skills place us uniquely to provide value for money to secure income benefits. We'll update you further on the new products early next year. Now, with that, I'd like to turn it over to questions.

2291,Rodney Malcolm Cook,20140918_Just_Group_PLC-_Earnings_Call_2014-9-18_FS000000002174143300.pdf,2014-09-18,270.0,1,0,Just Group," 14008420  Thank you, Simon. Some reasonably good numbers, and now a look into the future. So what is the outlook for Just Retirement given everything that's going on? Well, firstly, can I bring us back to the demographics in the overall retirement income market? And the first point here, as you can see from the top two charts, it doesn't matter how hard the government tries, they can't stop people getting older, and the demographic demand for at and in retirement financial products remains favorable as you see in the top two charts. And in the bottom left, the UK population is getting older. You can see clearly they're factoring in all the planned increase in the state age of retirement, pension age for both men and women. But over time, the UK will deliver consistent growth in the total retired population. Now, this is particularly so among men, and as you might remember, the majority of retirements savings are still held by men that go through retirement rather than women. Now, although low-interest rates and other factors such as the end of the normal retirement age within employment contracts has encouraged more employees to further retirement or take part-time retirement, overall, we are confident that in the bottom righthand chart, you'll see the current flow into the retirement in the market of £17 billion. And that by the way is the defined contribution retirement income markets. The present value of people retiring with defined benefits would be somewhere around £40 billion on top of that each year in present value terms. So we expect that £17 billion annual flow to grow according to Towers Watson's most recent survey defined contribution to around £50 billion by 2023. And of course, they're taking clearly into account the trend from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes over that period increasing. Now, the more difficult question is how much of that £17 billion or £50 billion will create demand and flow into products which offer guaranteed income given the changes that the Chancellor has just announced. I'll talk about that next. But here, I can't make any promises about the future. So, the question I post at the top of the slide, what will the new retirement income market look like? I would have to observe that there are many views as the answer posed by that question. The reforms in the March budget represent a once-in-a-lifetime upheaval for retirement income products. As we've already touched upon, these are now the transitional rules introduced on the 27th of March have reduced demand for individual annuities amongst those that Simon mentioned, very small pots because people are now allowed to catch up to £30,000 and also for very large savings cost. Here, people seeking flexible (3023) benefits they're required to have a guaranteed income of £20,000 per annum to access the balance of their pension account. And of course, they were purchasing some part of that through annuity. So that was immediately reduced to £12,500 on the 27th of March. Now, along with the deferrals Simon mentioned, this has led to roughly just over a halving of demand in the open market for annuities. And as you know, we adjust retirement on open markets. Starting in April 2015, consumers will have even more freedom then to deal with their funds regardless of the size of their pension pots. So, the £30,000 will stop being relevant. Some commentators had boldly suggested that everyone will take all of their pension in cash. I sincerely hope that some of these commentators would also consider reminding consumers of the very significant tax consequences of doing so. After all, if HMRC has taken nearly 50% of your life savings, I'm sorry, you cannot spend them later on. But it is also how to know about the new world and how it will look, and have a clear idea of precisely what the guaranteed guidance we'll deliver because that process hasn't been finalized as we speak. And even when we do know the details of what TPAS and Money Advice Service and so on are intending to deliver under that guidance, we don't know consumers' reaction to it and how many will take it up seriously. Now, our guidance could actually significantly increase the number of cases that we at Just Retirement can quote upon. As you know, we only quote on customers coming to the open market. So we are seeking and strongly guiding the Financial Conduct Authority on two points here. One, that they should use terminology that customers would relate to such as you have the right to shop around and buy yield products from anybody and not use terminology like open market options, which no one in the industry actually understand. And secondly, for those people who don't take up any form of guidance, that there'll be a second line of defense that the regulator requires pension providers to give additional support to those customers who, perhaps, unwisely chose not to take advantage of independent guidance. But clearly, those propositions could be very helpful to us and could increase the numbers of customers that seek out an external growth. That, however, is one scenario. And in truth, we do not know what the final guidance regime will look like. And as I mentioned, we can't predict exactly how consumers will respond to that guidance even once we know the details. As Simon mentioned, this could mean some people will sit on their hands until April next year once the new environment is clearer. We could easily see a market where people take their tax free cash and leave the remainder of their retirement money at work in some form of investment market vehicle, perhaps eking out their income with some part time work, and then eventually purchasing a lifetime income when they're slightly older. So we could see a pickup in older age annuitization. And here – but unfortunately for them, of course, at that later age, they will perhaps be less healthy. And here the silver lining is that we can then offer them a higher standard of living due to PrognoSys, our state-of-the-art medical underwriting system. That allows us to offer those customers higher rates of income, taking account that their health and lifestyle conditions rather than just wondering where they live. Currently, we predominately underwrite unhealthy lives as I think you all know, but ultimately, we may become competitive for healthy lives also and remembering that's at least half of the total market. We still predict that the whole market will become totally underwritten medically. And that cross subsidies that now exist in the standard market become unviable as a pricing approach. We're currently working on products for customers who don't actually want to annuitize the totality of their pension savings up front at the time. In other words, they'd like some guaranteed income. And they'd like to hold some assets in reserve. We'll talk more about those products as we get closer to launch in 2015. But I think you can see from our record over the last 10 years, we're quite proud of our product and innovation skills. And you can be well assured that we are doing plenty of market research currently utilizing those excellent IFA relationships to test out our new product ideas as we plan to launch them throughout 2015. And it's important to make that point throughout 2015. It will be not possible for the markets (3634) every new product that is launched on the 1st of April. So we think that the budget changes represent a huge opportunity for both retirees and for the savings industry. And we plan to play a full part in that new and innovative future. So our product range could serve increasing numbers of consumers who wish to take advantage of those new freedoms and I include here the healthy and the unhealthy, the 50% that we've been dealing with today. We're including some people who would like to keep and take some investment risk, as well as those who would like the security and safety of a guaranteed income which lasts for as long as they live; it doesn't run out. Although the budget clearly has been tough for us, we can certainly envisage an annuity market which will regrow once a new base level has been established. Like you, we cannot quantify exactly the effects of all of this. But we believe by this time next year we should have much greater clarity to share. On the positive front, the news with respect to defined benefits and lifetime mortgages is unequivocally positive. Simon has touched upon lifetime mortgages in detail. So if I can give you a little bit more background to our defined benefit annuities. So we have a defined benefit de-risking team that has delivered nothing but good news, which as you might imagine, has been well received over these past few months. The leader of that team, Tim Coulson, has assembled a group of 15 strong who are as experienced as any others who are participating in this segment of the market and the fruits of their labor are beginning to become clear. We have or are in the process of completing 60 underwriting processes. Most employee benefit consultants, as you know are the gatekeepers for large pension schemes and medium sized pension schemes trustee, have become involved. And at the current time, there are three providers to four providers participating in this market. Now we at Just Retirement focus on schemes where liabilities are concentrated either amongst a relatively small pool of members. And here, I mean, by underwriting, say 20% of the members. We're covering 80% or more of the liabilities. These have, of course, typically (3937) in those companies. We are also targeting schemes where the trustees may already be aware of health issues amongst their members or where the overall mortality based on the company and their operations happens to be above market average. Now, we are almost as nervous about giving you a forecast with respect to defined benefit volumes just as we are, and Simon was, with respect to volumes for individual annuities. But I must stress that this is more a function of the lumpiness of that market and not because we don't see fundamental growth in the defined benefit de-risking market overall; which I believe you've also heard from a number of large competitors, nor about our capabilities to play in the space. When I talk about our 15 strong team this does not include administration. So there are people on the ground who are both pricing, and then participating and presenting to EBCs and trustees. So in fact, our pipeline continues to grow. And most pleasingly the medically underwritten defined benefits sector is also gaining traction. So on balance, we think we can further good growth above the results in 2014, which has been established. But as you know trustees tend to meet quarterly. They make binary decisions on whether or not they are going to de-risk or not. Then they make a binary decision on who is going to be awarded for this or not. And therefore, it is not possible or appropriate for me to predict future sales on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We are particularly pleased to see the trends have now emerging that either very large schemes are considering medically underwriting the highest value pensioners in their schemes. This is the concept the industry is calling, top slicing. And this means that as an underwriter, Just Retirement, we can now participate in tenders we wouldn't have even been advised of previously. So this could be in multibillion pound scheme to which the top slice group of members. This is a market that we are skilled and able to participate in. On that aspect we expect the consulting activities to drive further growth of. So we expect structural growth in the overall DB market, and in our particular segment thereof; so more and more members are moving into the pension phase, and as I mentioned – well, as I will mention, our administration is provided by JLT, and that gives us full scalability in terms of business volumes. Finally, to the outlook, so after all that discussion, where does it lead us; and what does it add up to? Unfortunately, like you, we are having to work in an environment of considerable uncertainty particularly as the period up until April 2013 approaches. I don't believe you would have believed me, if I had told you anything different. But we are realistic about the challenges that we face. And as our prompt announcement of cost saving in our May IMS, clearly demonstrated, we are not going to just shy away from taking difficult decisions. However, given the uncertainties in the market, we won't be making any further specific comments about earnings guidance in addition to the ones that Simon has sought to cover with you earlier today. You might observe that forecast of the markets themselves span a very wide range at the moment. But we are well aware as our responsibilities to you and to the market to keep an eye on market expectations. And we will do that. So in conclusion, I'm proud to be leading the Just Retirement Group which has shown itself capable of delivering results like those we've just presented against what have been in some of the toughest of backgrounds and situations. And I want to record my thanks publicly to the management team and all of the staff for their hard work. I know that if we continue to work together the way we have done at Just Retirement since the budget announcement on the 19th of March, then no one will have a better chance of delivering for both our customers and for shareholders in this new pensions environment. Thank you for your attention. And we will now turn to questions, please. Q&A",   Thank you  Some reasonably good numbers and now a look into the future So what is the outlook for Just Retirement given everything that's going on? Well firstly can I bring us back to the demographics in the overall  income market? And the first point here as you can see from the top two chs it doesn't matter how hard the government tries they can't stop people getting ol and the demographic demand for at and in  financial products remains favorable as you see in the top two chs And in the  left the UK population is getting ol You can see clearly they're factoring in all the planned increase in the state age of  pension age for both men and women But over time the UK will iver consistent growth in the total retired population Now this is picularly so among men and as you might remember the majority of s savings are still held by men that go through  rather than women Now although low-interest rates and other factors such as the end of the normal  age within employment contracts has encouraged more employees to further  or take p-time  overall we are confit that in the  righthand ch you'll see the current flow into the  in the market of £ billion And that by the way is the defined contribution  income markets The present value of people retiring with defined benefits would be somewhere around £ billion on top of that each year in present value terms So we expect that £ billion annual flow to grow according to Towers 's most recent survey defined contribution to around £ billion by  And of course they're taking clearly into  the trend from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes over that period increasing Now the more difficult question is how much of that £ billion or £ billion will create demand and flow into products which offer guaranteed income given the changes that the cellor has just announced I'll talk about that next But here I can't make any promises about the future So the question I post at the top of the slide what will the new  income market look like? I would have to observe that there are many views as the answer posed by that question The reforms in the h budget represent a once-in-a-lifetime upheaval for  income products As we've already touched

the £ will stop being relet Some commentators had boldly suggested that everyone will take all of their pension in cash I sincerely hope that some of these commentators would also consi reminding consumers of the very significant tax consequences of doing so After all if HMRC has taken nearly % of your life savings I'm sorry you cannot spend them later on But it is also how to know about the new world and how it will look and have a clear idea of precisely what the guaranteed guidance we'll iver because that process hasn't been finalized as we speak And even when we do know the details of what TPAS and Money Advice Service and so on are intending to iver un that guidance we don't know consumers' reaction to it and how many will take it up seriously Now our guidance could actually significantly increase the number of cases that we at Just Retirement can quote u As you know we only quote on customers coming to the open market So we are seeking and strongly guiding the  Conduct Authority on two points here One that they should use terminology that customers would relate to such as you have the right to shop around and buy yield products from anybody and not use terminology like open market options which no one in the industry actually unstand And secondly for those people who don't take up any form of guidance that there'll be a second  of defense that the regulator requires pension provis to give additional support to those customers who perhaps unwisely chose not to take adtage of indepent guidance But clearly those propositions could be very helpful to us and could increase the numbers of customers that seek out an external growth That however is one scenario And in truth we do not know what the final guidance regime will look like And as I mentioned we can't predict exactly how consumers will resd to that guidance even once we know the details As  mentioned this could mean some people will sit on their hands until April next year once the new environment is clearer We could easily see a market where people take their tax free cash and leave the remain of their  money at work in some form of  market vehicle perhaps eking out their income with some p time work and then eventually purchasing a lifetime income when they're slightly ol So we could see a pickup in ol age annuitization And here – but unfortunately for them of course at that later age they will perhaps be less healthy And here the silver lining is that we can then offer them a higher standard of living due to PrognoSys our state-of-the- medical unwriting system That allows us to offer those customers higher rates of income taking  that their health and lifestyle conditions rather than just woning where they live Currently we predominately unwrite unhealthy lives as I think you all know but ultimately we may become competitive for healthy lives also and remembering that's at least half of the total market We still predict that the whole market will become totally unwritten medically And that cross subsidies that now exist in the standard market become unviable as a ping approach We're currently working on products for customers who don't actually want to annuitize the totality of their pension savings up front at the time In other words they'd like some guaranteed income And they'd like to hold some assets in reserve We'll talk more about those products as we get closer to launch in  But I think you can see from our record over the last  years we're quite proud of our product and innovation skills And you can be well assured that we are doing plenty of market research currently utilizing those excellent IFA relationships to test out our new product ideas as we plan to launch them throughout  And it's important to make that point throughout  It will be not possible for the markets  every new product that is launched on the st of April So we think that the budget changes represent a huge opporty for both retirees and for the savings industry And we plan to play a full p in that new and innovative future So our product range could serve increasing numbers of consumers who wish to take adtage of those new freedoms and I include here the healthy and the unhealthy the % that we've been dealing with today We're including some people who would like to keep and take some   as well as those who would like the security and safety of a guaranteed income which lasts for as long as they live; it doesn't run out Although the budget clearly has been tough for us we can certainly envisage an annuity market which will regrow once a new base level has been established Like you we cannot quantify exactly the effects of all of this But we beve by this time next year we should have much greater clarity to share On the positive front the news with respect to defined benefits and lifetime mortgages is unequivocally positive  has touched u lifetime mortgages in detail So if I can give you a little bit more background to our defined benefit annuities So we have a defined benefit de-ing team that has ivered nothing but good news which as you might imagine has been well received over these past few months The lea of that team   has assembled a  of  strong who are as experienced as any others who are picipating in this segment of the market and the fruits of their labor are beginning to become clear We have or are in the process of completing  unwriting processes Most employee benefit consultants as you know are the gatekeepers for large pension schemes and medium sized pension schemes trustee have become involved And at the current time there are three provis to four provis picipating in this market Now we at Just Retirement focus on schemes where liabilities are concentrated either amongst a relatively small pool of members And here I mean by unwriting say % of the members We're covering % or more of the liabilities These have of course typically  in those companies We are also targeting schemes where the trustees may already be aware of health issues amongst their members or where the overall mortality based on the company and their operations happens to be above market average Now we are almost as nervous about giving you a forecast with respect to defined benefit volumes just as we are and  was with respect to volumes for individual annuities But I must stress that this is more a function of the lumpiness of that market and not because we don't see fundamental growth in the defined benefit de-ing market overall; which I beve you've also heard from a number of large competitors nor about our capabilities to play in the space When I talk about our  strong team this does not include administration So there are people on the ground who are both ping and then picipating and presenting to EBCs and trustees So in fact our pipe continues to grow And most pleasingly the medically unwritten defined benefits sector is also gaining traction So on balance we think we can further good growth above the results in  which has been established But as you know trustees tend to meet querly They make binary decisions on whether or not they are going to de- or not Then they make a binary decision on who is going to be awarded for this or not And therefore it is not possible or appropriate for me to predict future sales on a quer-by-quer basis We are picularly pleased to see the trends have now emerging that either very large schemes are consiing medically unwriting the highest value pensioners in their schemes This is the concept the industry is calling top slicing And this means that as an unwriter Just Retirement we can now picipate in tens we wouldn't have even been advised of previously So this could be in multibillion pound scheme to which the top slice  of members This is a market that we are skilled and able to picipate in On that aspect we expect the consulting activities to drive further growth of So we expect structural growth in the overall DB market and in our picular segment thereof; so more and more members are moving into the pension phase and as I mentioned – well as I will mention our administration is provided by JLT and that gives us full scalability in terms of  volumes Finally to the outlook so after all that discussion where does it lead us; and what does it add up to? Unfortunately like you we are having to work in an environment of consiable uncertainty picularly as the period up until April  approaches I don't beve you would have beved me if I had told you anything different But we are realistic about the challenges that we face And as our prompt announcement of cost saving in our May IMS clearly demonstrated we are not going to just shy away from taking difficult decisions However given the uncertainties in the market we won't be making any further specific comments about earnings guidance in addition to the ones that  has sought to cover with you earr today You might observe that forecast of the markets themselves span a very wide range at the moment But we are well aware as our ressibilities to you and to the market to keep an eye on market expectations And we will do that So in conclusion I'm proud to be leading the Just Retirement  which has shown itself capable of ivering results like those we've just presented against what have been in some of the toughest of backgrounds and situations And I want to record my thanks publicly to the  team and all of the staff for their hard work I know that if we continue to work together the way we have done at Just Retirement since the budget announcement on the th of h then no one will have a better chance of ivering for both our customers and for sharehols in this new

I'm David Richardson, the Group's Deputy CEO and Managing Director of JRP's UK Corporate Business. I'm joined today by Tim Coulson, who is the Head of our DB De-Risking team. And thank you very much for coming around today in person and we are delighted to welcome you here for a closer look at our Defined Benefit De-Risking business or DB for short. And for those on conference call, the presentation materials are available in the Report and Presentation section of our website www.jrpgroup.com and also just advise you that this call is being recorded. In terms of running order, I'm going to start off by providing a macro view on what is driving this exciting market. Tim will then take you through (inaudible) and we will then have a Q&A session and there should be plenty of time for this. So I please ask that you save up your questions. And finally, at the end there will be a chance for you to follow up with us informally over coffee. The session today is being held in response to a number of requests to understand better DB markets and just questions within that. Hope today, we will answer those questions. We will focus on the markets and try to bring it to light. Hope you will come away from the session with a much better understanding. Now remember, today is not about our financial goals or guidance on future and financial results. We will cover that at our full-year 2016 results in two weeks time. I will review the macro view as I said of the DB markets, what the key drivers of the growth are and why we believe these are pointing strongly in the right direction. Tim will then talk about where we are in the development of Just DB business, our vision for the future and how we see our addressable market. He will then talk about we compete in our chosen market segments before explaining how DB transactions work and why can we win. I will finish up by pushing on two key enablers, which are not specific to our DB business. But will support our success in this area like our mortgages and reinsurance. Now, before we go any further, I think it is important that we take stock of DB significant as a profit driver of the JRP Group. So on slide four you see that DB accounted for more than half of our sales in both 2015 and 2016. Given that we are achieving similar margins in DB as we are in GIfL, this represents a fundamental diversification of our business model, significantly reducing business risk. We are no longer (inaudible) GIfL markets. This is a great example of JRP using our dynamism and innovation to create significant shareholder value. The scale of the DB operation also allows us to shift capital tactically between GIfL and DB (multiple speakers) returns are higher. So we can focus on optimizing (technical difficulty) and return capital for the Group as a whole. We have around 10% market share in the overall DB de-risking market. We have completed more than 100 transactions since inception making us a well-established player with (technical difficulty). So we are talking about an operation, which is already at the heart of the Group and (by nature) at the heart of this industry. Moving on to slide 5, I want to look at DB de-risking from the customers point of view. Large-scale DB pension schemes were first established in the 1940s and 1950s. And subsequently served the way for employers to attract and retain skilled employees in competitive labor markets. However, as the true cost of these long-term (technical difficulty) sponsors gradually withdrew the DB benefits. This is like the situation whereby today 85% of DB schemes are now closed. A lot of the customers (inaudible) sponsoring companies will take a keen interest in de-risking process, given they're writing the checks. IAS 19 means that since 1998, UK sponsoring companies have had to recognize their pension scheme position at year-end market value in the accounts. Discounting liabilities are prevailing double AA corporate bond yields. Market fluctuations, therefore, create significant asset value volatility, which (analyzes) the sponsoring company's principal activity. Due to account volatility, however (inaudible) are generally deteriorating economic risks that sponsoring companies are exposed to through their pension schemes. This has driven pensions of the Board Agenda of UK Corporate. For example, should a manufacturing company be exposed to long tail longevity, equity risk for example. The sponsors covenant means they are legally obliged to ensure (inaudible) scheme and provide the contractual retirement benefits to employee members. The scheme ultimately needs to hold assets equal to technical provisions. (inaudible) funding objective is discussed at least every three years by external actuarial valuation. Technical provisions discount the retirement benefits typically in the range of gilts to gilts plus 50 basis points. This is almost always a more (owners) basis than the AA basis, which comes through the accounts under IAS 19. Now the topic left is the technical provisions, the scheme is in (deficits) and a recovery plan must be developed. Even worse, the deficit will be viewed by the rating agencies as equivalent debt adding to financing (halts). The deficit recovery plan will typically aim to repair the deficit over the following 10 years through additional cash contribution by the sponsors. As you can see from newspaper headlines sprinkled around the background of the slide, this is a real issue, which can act as a significant drag on the share price of sponsors. So (technical difficulty) will be keen to fix the issue and focus on their underlying business. And one public example, last October, Rathbones raised GBP38 million, or 4.6% of share capital through share placing to provide an extra cushion to (inaudible) the capital as quote to quote (inaudible), which had a GBP58 million (inaudible). Going back towards (technical difficulty) unique shareholders relinquish 90% of their share and take GBP14 million of cash in exchange for a release in the Company's GBP433 million interest scheme liability to its members, one of the first instances where a scheme of arrangement was used to shed this kind of liability. The scheme subsequently went into the Pension Protection Fund and a pension obligation free unique was then sold to Greencore for GBP113 million, with GBP100 million delivered to the pension trustee. The entire pension scheme was subsequently bought out for GBP835 million securing an increment (to BHS) for the pension members. (inaudible) significance. In particular, the companies involved in co-productivity , the trustees and regulators can block a deal unless pensioner interests are protected. This may again require a significant contribution. Just to the background, as you can see from the chart, (all the loans) that IAS 19 or 18 was introduced in 1998 and natural markets and demographic trends have driven growing deficits (inaudible). Corporates have been facing a perfect storm in particular, AA bonds and Gilt yields have fallen dramatically, adding flows accounting and actuarial liabilities. This was coincided with system's increases in life expectancy. And as a result deficits have almost doubled over the past decade despite increased contribution. You can see this in the bottom left hand side. We can see the highest sponsoring employer contribution versus shareholder dividends in the table on the bottom right. This includes a number of household names, for them the scheme can feel like (inaudible) looking at cash for a recovery contribution. Most of them really have two options, runoff or de-risk. Runoff means accepting the balance sheet volatility and (hopefully) further debt to recovery contribution if the debt should deteriorate further. Waiting for economic and demographic trend to reverse has only made the problem worse in recent years, this has hurt a lot of companies. For these reasons, increasing numbers of sponsors are looking to de-risk their schemes. The long-term drivers and short-term catalysts are both in play for further growth in the de-risking market. So now that I've explained the various drivers for de-risking. I want to explain how our specific product fits into the overall process on slide 7. Typically an employer will start by closing the scheme to new employees, who will instead be offered a defined contribution scheme. Then they will stop existing members from accruing further DB benefits. These two steps stop the problem from getting bigger. At some point, they are likely to work harder at asset liability management to reduce volatility and hence reduce risk, because debt just grows further. This will typically start with buying bonds for pensioner payments, reducing inflation exposure and eventually moving to a formal liability-driven investments or LDI approach. Once they've moved to LDI they will probably soon be ready to think about the buy-in of pension repayments or the scheme is sufficiently mature at full buy-outs. Both buy-ins and buy-outs mean the scheme is no longer at risk of market fluctuations or longevity. We typically play a part in buy-in pension to payments where the pensioners are (inaudible) customers and where our ALM works best. We will sometimes write a portion of deferred but the liability is much longer and pricing is typically less attractive to trustees. Now in the buy-ins, the scheme buys an insurance policy from us, which delivers a series of cash flows, which we guarantee, would exactly match some of its potential liabilities. But the pension remains a liability of the scheme. The buy-in policy effectively becomes an asset of the pension scheme. Tim will go into detail as to why buy-ins are presently more common than buy-outs. But potentially, the buy-in at current prices is unlikely to change the scheme's solvency position. But it does reduce risk for the trustees. Anyway, key point is that our place in the process is towards the end of the scheme's journey and if the earlier stages are underway, there is a good chance that a buy-in will follow in due course. Now on to slide 8, now these charts show every stage of business life insurance becoming increasingly common. The top left chart shows that more and more schemes are closed for new members and future accrual for these new members. Over 85% are now closed for new. The only one potential scheme that's growing rapidly over the last five years is in the top row chart. This shows some more schemes are ready for buy-ins and this is mirrored by the actual fixed income holdings, which is rising and shown in the bottom left-hand chart. And finally, as the last chart shows, there has been increasing volume of buy-in and buyout transactions, which is adherent over there. In addition in 2016, there were approximately GBP9 billion of bulk purchase annuity transactions relating to in-force annuity portfolio, which used increased capital capacity, which otherwise would have been available for DB de-risking. This means total bulk purchase in each transaction reached record levels in (technical difficulty). If we take the first three charts here, can be viewed as leading indicators for the fourth given the process the trustees go through. And which I explained on the previous slide. In other words, there is every reason to spend a lot more of come in the DB de-risking markets. We completed new ongoing, strong pipeline of potential opportunity. So now showing the momentum already in the market, I want to try and quantify the potential. If you look at this two, first chart at our Capital Markets Day in October. So won't cover over that too much. Pensions and payments were between GBP600 billion and GBP800 billion, depending on whether you considered the Section 179 liability or the LDI value. And this contains our core market potential at present. However, as schemes mature and capital deficits, our vertical markets could eventually be the GBP2 trillion liabilities, which so far have not de-risked. The numbers are huge and to move these liabilities and corporate on to insurer balance sheet will take a generation at the current rate. And practically, we don't think that will be the case. We expect the rate of de-risking to accelerate significantly. And these charts on the bottom of the page are the ones that I want to focus on. The first shows the rate at which this enormous potential could be achieved for the market as a whole. Hymans Robertson are forecasting a significant increase in the number of 43 to 50 companies to this scheme, which will eliminate the deficits over the next decade, putting themselves in a better position to do a full buy-not, just a pension of buy-in. Now, this isn't too surprising given this 10-year recovery objective set by the pension regulators. Hymans also estimates that the amount of pension of buy-ins could receive GBP350 billion over the next 10 years, requiring a trebling of the DB de-risking markets in 2015 levels. And this quarter's market forecast on the previous slide. As you know, our focus is on the small DB-sized end of the markets. However, the key point to understand is that it's not the size of the scheme that matters to us, it's size of transaction that counts. Large schemes sometime choose to de-risk in small or medium sized tranches, for example, via top class or a separate pool of beneficiaries plus in relation to self-contained business units, acquired by sponsoring company in the past. Tim will explain this little bit detail using real life case study later on. The bottom right chart shows how we got on -- the low GBP200 billion transaction sized market has developed in recent years. We are active in this darker segment. And this segment accounted for 33% premiums in 2015. The last year of which we have full industry statistics . However, it isn't (inaudible) in premium accounts only. We seek opportunity and flow of transactions. And our analysis shows that this segment accounted for 167 transactions or 94% of all transactions, which completed that year. This is quite an important point and a thing of our approach. Conversely, that's one of the reasons why we do not compete for the (inaudible) deals which given the amount of premium we write, will introduce a significant degree of uncertainty into our annual sales performance. There are (inaudible) lumpiness we will tolerate especially given the weighting of new business profits to our Group operating earnings per share. We expect to drive the market as a whole, drive further growth in our target segments which will drive a steady stream of opportunities for us to pursue. Tim will expand on this segmentation in some detail later on. So we expect DB de-risking markets will continue to grow significantly and the demand dynamics appear stable. Any lowering forecast involve a high degree of productivity but the overall direction of travel seems crystal clear. Adding to the mix is the emergence of a further approximately GBP100 billion life company annuity platform of transfer markets, which has created additional demand for limited de-risking capital. In conclusion, the supply and demand dynamics of the industry are therefore likely to be capacity driven. So with that, I'll hand over to Tim to expand on how we transact in the Just way.",   Good afternoon everybody I'm  son the 's   and Managing  of JRP's UK porate  I'm joined today by   who is the  of

equity  for example The ssors covenant means they are legally obliged to ensure inaudible scheme and provide the contractual  benefits to employee members The scheme ultimately needs to hold assets equal to technical provisions inaudible funding objective is discussed at least every three years by external actuarial valuation Technical provisions discount the  benefits typically in the range of gilts to gilts plus  basis points This is almost always a more owners basis than the AA basis which comes through the s un IAS  Now the topic left is the technical provisions the scheme is in deficits and a recovery plan must be developed Even worse the deficit will be viewed by the rating agencies as equivalent debt adding to financing halts The deficit recovery plan will typically aim to repair the deficit over the following  years through additional cash contribution by the ssors As you can see from newspaper heads sprinkled around the background of the slide this is a real issue which can act as a significant drag on the share pe of ssors So technical difficulty will be keen to fix the issue and focus on their unlying  And one public example last October Rathbones raised GBP million or % of share capital through share placing to provide an extra cushion to inaudible the capital as quote to quote inaudible which had a GBP million inaudible Going back towards technical difficulty unique sharehols relinquish % of their share and take GBP million of cash in exchange for a release in the 's GBP million interest scheme liability to its members one of the first instances where a scheme of arrangement was used to shed this kind of liability The scheme subsequently went into the Pension Protection Fund and a pension obligation free unique was then sold to core for GBP million with GBP million ivered to the pension trustee The entire pension scheme was subsequently bought out for GBP million securing an increment to BHS for the pension members inaudible significance In picular the companies involved in co-productivity  the trustees and regulators can block a deal unless pensioner interests are protected This may again require a significant contribution Just to the background as you can see from the ch all the loans that IAS  or  was introduced in  and natural markets and demographic trends have driven growing deficits inaudible porates have been facing a perfect storm in picular AA bonds and Gilt yields have fallen dramatically adding flows ing and actuarial liabilities This was coincided with system's increases in life expectancy And as a result deficits have almost doubled over the past decade despite increased contribution You can see this in the  left hand side We can see the highest ssoring employer contribution versus sharehol divids in the table on the  right This includes a number of household names for them the scheme can feel like inaudible looking at cash for a recovery contribution Most of them really have two options runoff or de- Runoff means accepting the balance sheet volatility and hopefully further debt to recovery contribution if the debt should deteriorate further Waiting for economic and demographic trend to reverse has only made the problem worse in recent years this has hurt a lot of companies For these reasons increasing numbers of ssors are looking to de- their schemes The long-term drivers and short-term catalysts are both in play for further growth in the de-ing market So now that I've explained the various drivers for de-ing I want to explain how our specific product fits into the overall process on slide  Typically an employer will st by closing the scheme to new employees who will instead be offered a defined contribution scheme Then they will stop existing members from accruing further DB benefits These two steps stop the problem from getting bigger At some point they are likely to work har at asset liability  to reduce volatility and hence reduce  because debt just grows further This will typically st with buying bonds for pensioner payments reducing inflation exposure and eventually moving to a formal liability-driven s or LDI approach Once they've moved to LDI they will probably soon be ready to think about the buy-in of pension repayments or the scheme is sufficiently mature at full buy-outs Both buy-ins and buy-outs mean the scheme is no longer at  of market fluctuations or longevity We typically play a p in buy-in pension to payments where the pensioners are inaudible customers and where our ALM works best We will sometimes write a portion of deferred but the liability is much longer and ping is typically less attractive to trustees Now in the buy-ins the scheme buys an  policy from us which ivers a series of cash flows which we guarantee would exactly match some of its potential liabilities But the pension remains a liability of the scheme The buy-in policy effectively becomes an asset of the pension scheme  will go into detail as to why buy-ins are presently more common than buy-outs But potentially the buy-in at current pes is unlikely to change the scheme's solvency position But it does reduce  for the trustees Anyway key point is that our place in the process is towards the end of the scheme's journey and if the earr stages are unway there is a good chance that a buy-in will follow in due course Now on to slide  now these chs show every stage of  life  becoming increasingly common The top left ch shows that more and more schemes are closed for new members and future accrual for these new members Over % are now closed for new The only one potential scheme that's growing rapidly over the last five years is in the top row ch This shows some more schemes are ready for buy-ins and this is mirrored by the actual fixed income holdings which is rising and shown in the  left-hand ch And finally as the last ch shows there has been increasing volume of buy-in and buyout transactions which is adherent over there In addition in  there were approximately GBP billion of bulk purchase annuity transactions relating to in-force annuity portfolio which used increased capital capacity which otherwise would have been available for DB de-ing This means total bulk purchase in each transaction reached record levels in technical difficulty If we take the first three chs here can be viewed as leading indicators for the fourth given the process the trustees go through And which I explained on the previous slide In other words there is every reason to spend a lot more of come in the DB de-ing markets We completed new ongoing strong pipe of potential opporty So now showing the momentum already in the market I want to try and quantify the potential If you look at this two first ch at our Capital ets  in October So won't cover over that too much Pensions and payments were between GBP billion and GBP billion depending on whether you consied the Section  liability or the LDI value And this contains our core market potential at present However as schemes mature and capital deficits our vertical markets could eventually be the GBP trillion liabilities which so far have not de-ed The numbers are huge and to move these liabilities and corporate on to insurer balance sheet will take a generation at the current rate And practically we don't think that will be the case We expect the rate of de-ing to accelerate significantly And these chs on the  of the page are the ones that I want to focus on The first shows the rate at which this enormous potential could be achieved for the market as a whole Hymans son are forecasting a significant increase in the number of  to  companies to this scheme which will eliminate the deficits over the next decade putting themselves in a better position to do a full buy-not just a pension of buy-in Now this isn't too surprising given this -year recovery objective set by the pension regulators Hymans also estimates that the amount of pension of buy-ins could receive GBP billion over the next  years requiring a trebling of the DB de-ing markets in  levels And this quer's market forecast on the previous slide As you know our focus is on the small DB-sized end of the markets However the key point to unstand is that it's not the size of the scheme that matters to us it's size of transaction that counts Large schemes sometime choose to de- in small or medium sized tranches for example via top class or a separate pool of beneficiaries plus in relation to self-contained  s acquired by ssoring company in the past  will explain this little bit detail using real life case study later on The  right ch shows how we got on -- the low GBP billion transaction sized market has developed in recent years We are active in this darker segment And this segment ed for % premiums in  The last year of which we have full industry statistics  However it isn't inaudible in premium s only We seek opporty and flow of transactions And our analysis shows that this segment ed for  transactions or % of all transactions which completed that year This is quite an important point and a thing of our approach Conversely that's one of the reasons why we do not compete for the inaudible deals which given the amount of premium we write will introduce a significant degree of uncertainty into our annual sales performance There are inaudible lumpiness we will tolerate especially given the weighting of new  profits to our  operating earnings per share We expect to drive the market as a whole drive further growth in our target segments which will drive a steady stream of opporties for us to pursue  will expand on this segmentation in some detail later on So we expect DB de-ing markets will continue to grow significantly and the demand dynamics appear stable Any lowering forecast involve a high degree of productivity but the overall direction of travel seems crystal clear Adding to the mix is the emergence of a further approximately GBP billion life company annuity platform of transfer markets which has created additional demand for ed de-ing capital In conclusion the supply and demand dynamics of the industry are therefore likely to be capacity driven So with that I'll hand over to  to expand on how we transact in the Just way,afternoon son porate today team today person look efit conference presentation material section website

Currently, we have a market share of 15% and expect to increase this. 25% of the markets new production in 2020 also already done by us. And as mentioned earlier, retention rates are very high. Our DC proposition is unique on its own, because it has a focus on both digital and ESG.

Today I will discuss our full-year results and outlook for 2020, then briefly comment on our results for the fourth quarter. Life and Retirement recorded adjusted pre-tax income of $3.46 billion for the full-year and delivered adjusted return on attributed common equity at 13.7%. Adjusted pre-tax income increased by $268 million from the prior year. Solid underlying results were further supported by capital markets conditions and their effect on both assets and liabilities. Impacts from accretive equity market returns, increased by $244 million including higher fee income, lower deferred acquisition cost, amortization and higher returns on alternative investments. Short-term positive impacts from lower interest rates and credit spreads increased by $154 million, including higher returns on fair value option securities and gains on calls. Our earnings also benefited from higher assets due to new business growth. These positive impacts were partially offset by a further impact from spread compression of approximately $112 million or 7 basis points annually and investments to enhance our operating platforms. As to our top-line, 2019 was a good example of our strategy to accelerate or moderate new business depending on relative returns. With very favorable pricing conditions during the first quarter, we deployed significant capital in individual retirement and produced robust new business volume at attractive margins. As rates and spreads declined over the remaining three quarters, we adjusted our pricing and reduced individual annuity sales levels, as our view of margins became less attractive. At the same time, we achieved record year for new group acquisitions and group retirement and continued to grow international sales for our Life Insurance business and focused on consistent profitable growth in institutional markets. Looking ahead to full-year 2020, we expect adjusted pre-tax income to be more in line year treasury rates around 1.7%. To give you an idea of market sensitivity of our adjusted earnings, including impact to both assets and liabilities, a 1% decrease in equity market returns would decrease adjusted pre-tax income by approximately $30 million to $40 million annually and there would be a corresponding increase in earnings from a 1% increase in equity market returns. A 10 basis points decrease in 10-year treasury rates would decrease earnings by approximately $5 million to $15 million annually and there would be a corresponding increase in earnings from a 10 basis point increase in treasury rates. It is important to note at these market sensitivity ranges are not exact nor linear, since our earnings are also impacted by the timing and degree of interest rate movements, as well as credit spreads and other factors. Based on our interest rate level assumptions, our expectation for fullyear 2020, is for base investment spreads across the whole portfolio to decline by approximately 8 to 16 basis points annually with the middle of the range resulting in a headwind of approximately $200 million. Based on our expectations for rates and spreads, we expect negative net flows for group retirement and individual retirement for the year with decreased levels of individual annuity sales, particularly and fixed annuities. Finally, from a statutory perspective, we expect to continue to generate solid earnings and maintain strong capitalization for our operating entities. Now, I will briefly discuss our results for the fourth quarter. Life and Retirement recorded adjusted pre-tax income of $839 million for the quarter. Adjusted pre-tax income increased by $216 million from the prior-year quarter. Impacts from accretive equity market returns, increased by $176 million and short-term positive impacts from lower interest rates and credit spreads increased by $46 million. These positive impacts were partially offset by spread compression and previously mentioned investments to enhance our operating platform. For Individual Retirement, premiums and deposits decreased primarily due to lower fixed annuity sales reflecting low rates and reducing credit spreads. Lower sales resulted in decreased net flows for total individual annuities. Our total assets under administration grew driven by strong equity market performance and higher annuity net flows in the first half of the year. For Group Retirement premiums and deposits increased by 10% from the prior-year quarter, driven by strong new group acquisition results. Net flows were below the prioryear quarter due to higher group surrenders. Despite this negative net flows for a period of time, we've continued to produce solid earnings for this business as assets under administration have continued to grow. For our Life Insurance business, total premiums and deposits increased due to higher international sales. Our US Life sales declined as we continue to de-emphasize guaranteed Universal Life sales in the current interest rate environment, and Indexed Universal Life sales remained under pressure. Lastly, our overall mortality returned to trend and was once again favorable making this 10 out of the last 12 quarters where mortality was either at or favorable to pricing assumptions. For Institutional Markets, we have continued to grow our asset base and earnings in the business continues to be well-positioned to capitalize on available growth while remaining focused on achieving targeted returns. Deposits decreased due to robust pension risk transfer activity in the fourth quarter of last year. Across our businesses, we are continuing to invest as needed to prepare for the evolving regulatory and accounting landscape and to leverage these ongoing investments to further improve our efficiency and competitive position. We are pleased with the comprehensive retirement reforms provided by the passage of the Secure Act. In addition to the expected outcome is increasing the availability of income solutions for participants in defined contribution plans, we believe that will ultimately enhance the overall education and awareness of the need for protective lifetime income as part of a comprehensive diversified retirement plan. For our Group Retirement business, we are evaluating several unique and lifetime income options. Other benefits of the Secure Act, include raising the age for required minimum distribution to 72 and eliminating the age limit for contributions to IRAs, all of which present opportunities for both our Group Retirement and Individual Retirement businesses. To close, we remain committed to our ongoing strategy to leverage our broad product expertise and distribution footprint to deploy capital to the most attractive opportunities, which we believe positions us well to help meet growing needs for protection, retirement savings and lifetime income solutions.

2465,Tim Coulson,20170222_Just_Group_PLC-_Guidance_Call_2017-2-22_SD000000002902478738.pdf,2017-02-22,189.0,1,0,Just Group,"Thanks David. Good afternoon. I'm Tim Coulson, Director of DB Solutions of Just and Rodney recruited me in 2012 to set up the DB business. And I have been working in the DB de-risking market since 2000. I'd like to cover all things today, especially a brief summary of what Just DB business, on what will be our vision for the future. Secondly, I'd like to set out clearly our addressable market is and where we choose to compete. . Thirdly, talk about our competitive position and why this is aligned to our strengths. And finally, I'll cover what's required to win DB business and how we transact this business the Just way. So our vision is to be the leading provider of small to medium sized DB de-risking solutions. We are (directing well in) that vision and as David said, the DB business was established and accounted by (Hart) group sales in the last of couple of calendar years. And entering the market in 2012, we first established the capability to compete and we then critically we established a track record for (asking credibility with improvement -consultants) will be safe, as well as trustees. We've certainly developed that proposition and continues to focus on areas of the DB market, where our strengths most (inaudible). The DB-King is fully integrated post merger and benefiting from the defined experience and expertise. As you see from the chart, we completed over 100 transactions with 19 different EBCs since we entered the market. And during those, we achieved a market share of 10%. In fact, we've been the market leader in GBP20 million to GBP150 million transaction size subsegment over the last couple of years with an average transaction size of around GBP65 million. Again, note other transactions are not schemes. We are very focused on transaction size rather than scheme size. And I will now tell you what this means to our customer. Part of this slide is readable. But does require some figures to explain. So if you look at table 1, table 1 may well be familiar to you. And the figures are directed from the Purple book. This shows a breakdown of schemes across the industry by number of members. And buy-out liability. Along with the split, pensioners, deferreds and actives. And GBP2.1 trillion in total liability figure, the figure David referred to earlier. So table 2, based on the figures from table 1, we have estimated what the average scheme liability looks like. We have the average scheme size. But also within that we have the average for pensioners, deferred and actives. You should be aware that majority of DB transactions of the pensions are all for tranche pensions only with the minority in technically smaller schemes, made for full buy-outs of the scheme and I'll explain that in a moment. Also keeping that it just targets transactions up to GBP250 million of size, we can then consider which of these segments are addressable budgets. So for example, in this segment with 1,000 to 4,999 members, average scheme liability is GBP439 million. However, the average pension liability is only GBP167 million. So the pensions will be clearly addressable to Just. If we consider the pensions generally, the segments in green, in dark green are clearly addressable pensioners. Those large pensions that goes in light green would be at least partially addressable to Just depends on transaction insurance. And moving to the first, actives, Just can and it transact on slow and steady in the liability transactions. Therefore, the second scheme yellow, our addressable for Just now, those are seen for future buyer-outs. For larger deferred liabilities number then, let's say transact as a full buy-out, which is fairly rare at this size. then those would also be addressable to Just in the future, as tranches to the pensioners when they have been bought. Type three, then simply total liability in saffron. So that's an overall imitation of addressable market. Now clearly some judgment is needed until you accept which of our schemes will transact to one or whole schemes or which will de-risk (inaudible) or additionally, how well funded the scheme on in fact, how suddenly you decide to transact. But hopefully you can see that Just has transact which we have seen in all segments of the market. The key takeaway from this chart is that the way you are hoping in the future, today we have an addressable market well over GBP200 billion. So following on from the previous slide, I'd like to explain why the majority of transactions in the market are the buy-in in almost -- for some of the pensioners rather than the buy-out of all pensioners and the third members and that's all the one that (technical difficulty). The figure that we have on the slide is high and that's because the exact numbers depend on the specifics of the scheme. And in particular the provisions assumptions, the scheme numbers relative to ensure pricing. And as we know in the detailed provisions scheme, the amount of scheme as the whole is to be fully funded on an ongoing basis. So considering those pension liabilities, more recently, we think a scheme to expect to secure buy-in for pensions as opposed to take provisions. Finally, the amount the corporate sponsor expects to come in line. The liabilities for pensioners are often back with gilts and bonds and so 19 are still are buy-in transaction, which will remain deficit until we paid provisions which also meets fund. However, with deferred member liabilities, this is more on us. Basically to the matching and capital requirements of ensured regulation that are pensioner scheme of course of pension scheme reports. Getting varied scheme specifics and with (inaudible) the buy-out premium for deferreds could easily be 130% or more technical provisions. And therefore, it requires sponsor contribution once beyond any deficit. So I think you can see why de-risking of pensioners is, is more a de-risking of pensioners only I should say is more common. Then deferreds are more often secured as tranches as its (team) members retire. However, just even though you want to or need to secure deferreds as well, driven often by a corporate transaction. Also and particularly for small schemes, it may be attractive to buy-out members and more into scheme, because the average, the actual costs and the running costs generally obfuscate are formed by the employer and for technical provisions. So for the small scheme, the present value of the running cost is very significant and saving these can enhance the extra buy-out cost of deferreds and the technical provisions. Also from an insurance perspective, deferred liabilities and buy-out are basically more difficult complex transaction to administer. And consequently, some insurers are unable or unwilling to transact the liabilities. As I said earlier, Just will not be able to see until the transactions further operates. About 10% of our transactions today have been buy-outs that contain an element of deferreds. However, we are very selective on the transactions and target. So that they fit into our business model and deliver us market (opportunities). (If I look earlier) the pension scheme document and the de-risking tranches, I'm now going to talk you through two examples of very large GBP1 billion sized pension schemes that we have de-risked. But now they should help to mobilize those transactions. This is actually one of the schemes we transacted with the last year. The scheme had total technical provisions significantly in excess of GBP1 billion, just broadly speaking (technical difficulty). So taking into account the current actives in the scheme in the best approach, this budget now schemes to two single premium buy-in transactions covering approximately GBP200 million of potential liabilities. Third buy-in was, we're trying to cover 120 hedges covering GBP100 million of liability. We saw innovation medical underwriting to help secure this transaction. The second buy-in covered another GBP100 million and an excessive 500 pension members that Just ended for. But ultimately secured by another provider using a traditional pricing coverage. Just is defining further transactions for remaining pensions and deferreds over time. Transaction two is a large FTSE 400 TLC we've transacted with. Again, we introduced innovation in (inaudible) which was another medically underwritten transaction for a very large scheme. Total assets of GBP2 billion, total members of which half of the patients were private. We worked the institution solution, we call trustworthy. The trustee each has partially given the pensioners by our buy-in covering 99 at the last liability members for over GBP206 million. I think the size, this is an example of where medical underwriting providing the pricing advantage that helped this transaction deliver new trustees GBP9.4 million below technical provisions. But again, we expect this gain to undertake further tranches of de-risking in the future. Given previous delivery, I think we're well placed to win additional business. From (inaudible), as I said earlier, all (technical difficulty) small to medium sized DB derisking solutions. You'll see from the table, we have a clear focus on where we can be and then I'll take you through the reasons why we are focused on these areas in the market. Firstly, while transacting a relatively large number of small and medium sized cases, we generate a lot of revenues with no-risk, I should say, low-risk in the industry, in the group. Although it's lumpy than our retail GIfL business, the DB business is more reliable and more stable than the buy-in nature of large DB transactions. Secondly, the size of the transactions you are going to evolve mortgages the net charge offs. DB transactions, better matches some of our LTM business that we use to bucket compared to the approach where we market a few large DB transactions each year. In addition, while transactions cover the small number of individual life of members, the advantages of medical underwriting are greater. You know that the large transaction market only had a handful of deals earlier. There more small and medium sized transactions, which provides us with a greater number of opportunities and so much of skill set (technical difficulty). And we've established capabilities pursuing still a large number of transactions. This is important, because this enables us to access a wider number of opportunities in the market to be more selective on the risk to life. This helps what business makes out for the targets. I don't want to sound over generalized. But it's worth saying that the smaller and medium-sized transaction like to take the deals that require a focused approach to pricing structure. We've made, here in Just, we've made personalization part of our life. And this helps us to positively differentiate our offer. And so, before I finish on this one slide, I would like to say a word on the degree of difficulty facing the new entrants to establish themselves in this sector. It is reasonably high because the pool of people who can actually get this work done is quite small relative to the scale of the UK Life (of this scope). These are the people in balance sheet business. But operates in a highly regulated environment. Just supplemented its existing group capabilities, which included investment, pricing, reinsurance, underwriting and longevity by making external hires of experienced professionals with DB experience. I'm now going to take you through different stages of the DB transaction. As we said, they will define each stage despite the -- they will following the following five stages. Three other opportunities, it will vary. But in a typical week of a month, we're seeing half a dozen of professional requests from EBC. These are expected to decline with the aim of maximizing the number of attractive transaction opportunities from which we target transactions that deliver our profit targets. Moving to detailed assessment to understand the opportunity, whether the scheme can afford to (inaudible) how it aligns to our business model, for example, size, the duration, whether we can utilize our IP both underwriting. And LCS. Initial quotation stage, this covers not only the price. But also confirming back to the advisors, the data and benefits provided. The key here is that scheme benefit is surety complex and we will be safe to ensure all quotes are like-for-like. We'd also be seeking to understand any additional scheme specific requirements that we can use to differentiate our offer. Next stage, usually a subset of insurance, when asked to provide further than final prices. And it is during this stage, we consider that transaction against the portfolio of other potential opportunities in our pipeline. And we attend for other requirements, the trustees might have. So that we can apply our own IP and personalize the quotation offer. For example, premium payment mechanism, ensuring the premium payment mechanism works for both us and the trustee. So the aftermarket risk is managed between realization scheme assets and premium received for example. So long term being at this stage of representation to trustees and EBCs to set off a particular solution. Stage four, the trustees will select an insurer to work with exclusively for transaction. During the exclusivity period where we find that we spoke in our transactions terms, most are how are the points and scheme assets are moving within the technical market conditions prepared to hedge the transaction. We'll obviously work until trustee's legal advisors remain in the degree of policy terms and conditions. And now we want different legal firms used on particular policy terms and having a solution to those is particularly important to ensure the transaction completes at vicious rate. And lastly stage five, the process is aimed at improving especially for us or the trustees. We want the trustees and their administrators to ensure that the date we closed on was correct and critically to ensure that payload is taken off on smoothly. So you can see there's quite a lot of detail here. And what I'll do, shortly show you how we do this the Just way and how we introduce innovation and use of our IP to differentiate our approach to win. To start you on the EBC channel. The new type Pensions Act 1995 technically requires BP Pension Trustees. So called professional advisors when posting at EBC products. This means the EBC have a very powerful position that gets to all these transactions. This successful mid-market, it's very, very important to have strong relationship with all advisors. But particularly EBC's brokering deal and the legal advisors to lead on the contractual negotiations. All the leading, double or so EBCs and the 20 or more leading pension law firms have all advised clients to transact with Just. We work in partnership with the EBCs, to deliver innovation to their clients notably medical underwriting included into hospitals. But also in the structuring of the transaction efficiently. We've also partnered a number of EBCs in developing a process to enable quicker transactions to the smaller-states. As a result of our strong relationships, we are seeing growing amount of repeat business. This is having experienced buy-out proposition including delivery, (inaudible) servicing subsequent return to us, deferred charges in (technical difficulty). So how do you -- what unique way in this DB world. There are number of components named especially to DB business. First is price. Price is always a key consideration and firstly are under the obligation to demonstrate that paying the competitive market points. But this isn't sufficient to win DB business. Second financial strength. Just had have the strong regulatory environment from a capital and PI process expected covering all insurers. This is off beyond the trustees, however, to demonstrate good process, they may conduct due diligence on this selective insurer while using a specialist advisor versus an offshore more information provided insurer. Transaction execution and administration. Especially what we came to understand the expertise within the DB team and the ability to execute from it and understanding of the track record of both insurer and the DB team considered and focus is around executing similar types of transactions in the past. And trust me, the decision particularly is surprisingly not around how to payroll the work. But how well we insure the new cost fee post transaction. We think this team is planning to ultimately buyout, they will also consider the policyholder experience and how they will be able to talk. Fourthly, bespoking, the bespoke structuring. Each team particularly don't have more and more requirements that are specific to the scheme. This is around having particularly complex on hedging specifics and need to move to individual member policies ahead of completing data plans, or any -- one of the numerous possibilities. The ability to dispose the opportunity but at the corner, it's important to secure that reflection and jump out of willingness and reputation. Next policy shows it's important that trustees have a contract that meet their needs, both now and also in the future. Of course, the contract will cover the basics around the pension payment, data cleansing. But it also have important closures that ensure the trustees discharge their liabilities in the future. So for example, even the beneficiaries to issue individual policies or restructure benefits also the events such as in floor and solvency. And finally recommendation of advisors. After considering all this, the trustees were looked at every decision and legal advised (inaudible) the insurer. The trustees will look to the EBC to provide them with a confidence that jobs can deliver what we promised. And to finish up, I'd like to leave you with summary of how we at Just are winning our five segments. Firstly, just rigorously focuses on the transactions in our private sector and which of our strength are best exploited. We use our medical underwriting IP and our ability to reason a high quality (technical difficulty). DP business is complex and every scheme has different requirements. Our reputation for innovation helps us support the competition. We have a rather established reputation and track record in this profit space. These notably relied on to deliver (inaudible) trustee. We are highly confident, professional and demonstrate our expertise in the solution design, execution and developing to a contracted theory.",Thanks  Good afternoon I'm    of DB  of Just and

cnts to transact with Just We work in  with the EBCs to iver innovation to their cnts notably medical unwriting included into hospitals But also in the structuring of the transaction efficiently We've also pnered a number of EBCs in developing a process to enable quicker transactions to the smaller-states As a result of our strong relationships we are seeing growing amount of repeat  This is having

shows it's important that trustees have a contract that meet their needs both now and also in the future Of course the contract will cover the basics around the pension payment data cleansing But it also have important closures that ensure the trustees discharge their liabilities in the future So for example even the beneficiaries to issue individual policies or restructure benefits also the

Today, I will talk about the dynamics and our ambitions in the corporate market in Norway. In the fast growing and changing occupational pension market, we aim to keep our number one position and market leadership. Next year, private sector occupational pensions will ﬁnally see the introduction of the individual pension accounts. This year, we have also been through regulatory changes within public sector as Storebrand has entered this market as a challenger with a broad product portfolio and clear ambitions. Today, I will explain to you our strategic thinking when it comes to occupational pension and also how we aim for proﬁtable growth from expanding our B2B oﬀering. If you look back at the market for private sector occupational pensions over the last few years, we clearly see the structural growth in the market, which come from the young nature of the deﬁned contribution pensions in Norway. Company Name Storebrand ASA Occupational pensions became mandatory in 2006 and growth in unit linked-based pension plans has been tremendous since that time. On an annual basis, the premium growth has been about 10% during the last ﬁve years and the AUM growth has been more than 20%. We are slowly seeing the market maturing, but we still expect high-single-digit growth in premiums and double-digit in AUM. Next year, there will be stricter follow-up from the authorities regarding some employees' violation of the mandatory premium payments. The premium increase is expected to be 10% in total. And at a political level, there is an ongoing discussion to increase the minimum level of mandatory savings, which can increase the premium level with additional 5% to 10%. During many years of successful growth, we have built up an attractive value proposition for our customers. First, Storebrand has cost-eﬀective processes and economies of scales, which create a basis for an attractive economic value proposition. Secondly, we oﬀer our customers high-performing ESG-enhanced investment portfolios. The consulting company, Mercer, has assessed the pension investment portfolios in the market during the last three years and Storebrand has achieved the highest score each year. Thirdly, Storebrand has market-leading digital pension portals for both employees and employers, including tools for planning for future retirement and self-service solutions. And ﬁnally, Storebrand has the most satisﬁed customers in the B2B market over the last 15 years, thanks to our high-quality service, digital solutions, and eﬃcient administration. Today, Storebrand is providing leading pension and insurance products and services to Norwegian customers. Storebrand is the only provider with a full range of occupational pension products across the private and public sector, both markets are fast growing. For occupational pensions, we believe our scale will be a competitive advantage when individual pension accounts are introduced next year. In the public sector market, we are also able to take advantage of our economies of scales and oﬀer public sector pension at a low marginal cost, enabling us to oﬀer competitive prices. Our insurance products include mandatory workers' compensation insurance and other risk covers that provide additional employee beneﬁts for the corporate customers. I'm happy to say that Storebrand holds a strong position in all diﬀerent product lines. With the inherent insurance know-how we have, it's a smaller step to oﬀer P&C insurance to small and medium-sized enterprises. With the acquisition of our portfolio from Insr, a small Norwegian player, we are already kick starting this new growth area. Our strategic priorities to maintain leadership and proﬁtability towards 2033 are ﬁrst, remain number one and market leader in private sector occupational pension market; second, become a fast-growing challenger within public sector, occupational pensions; and third, expand our insurance oﬀering to P&C insurance for small and medium enterprises. Company Name Storebrand ASA Individual pension accounts will be established from next year for each employee, with an active membership within an occupational pension plan. The pension account will be established at the employers' pension provider. Let me give you some background information. In Norway, there are two million pension capital certiﬁcates, which are unit linked-based policies from previous deﬁned contribution plans. The total AUM value is NOK120 billion. The pension capital certiﬁcates will, during next year, be included in the individual pension accounts, and for that reason, also change providers. We estimate that Storebrand will have a positive net transfer of pension capital of approximately NOK1 billion due to the change. So what happens with the fees and what revenue implications will we face in the industry? Due to the regulatory requirement regarding fees, there will be a reduction in the revenues for all the providers in the industry. Due to an implementation period throughout 2021, the proﬁt from this business is not expected to decrease until 2022. And in 2022, we expect that the proﬁt from the occupational pension business will decrease with approximately NOK100 million, but at the same time, the proﬁt from other B2B business lines will improve. We expect that our total proﬁt in the corporate market will be the same in 2021 and 2022 due to proﬁt improvement from the insurance portfolio. My key point is, the economic eﬀect for Storebrand, when introducing individual pension accounts will be moderate and we expect a rather quick result recovery. In addition, which is important, we have introduced new cost measures, which will improve the result from occupational pension business with NOK100 million a year in a few years. We expect the market of long-term savings and pension to merge. Storebrand is well positioned for this growth and individualization. With high-performing products and attractive digital solutions, Storebrand has, during the last years, achieved a close relationship to the employees in occupational pension schemes. This is an important asset going forward when we work with retaining existing and attracting new individual customers. In respect to the implementation of individual pension accounts, the focus has been on end-to-end digitization, all the way from the core system to the customer interface. The solutions are cost neutral in terms of volumes, and which is important, this will provide a valuable cost advantage and business volumes continue to grow. The digital investment is resulting in unprecedented customer satisfaction and cost leaderships in the years to come. As a leading occupational pension provider in the private sector, we have a great starting point when entering the public sector with our already existing solutions. Together with large customers in public sector, we have set up a new sustainable investment portfolio, which includes fossil free investments and extended use of ethical criterias. Company Name Storebrand ASA The public sector pension market is large compared to the private sector market, and in addition, we see a strong premium growth as well, estimated to 10% annually. We have set our realistic ambition as the aim to gain 1% market share annually, this means NOK5 billion in net AUM inﬂow every year, and our ﬁrst year has shown a breakthrough with successful business growth. So what about proﬁtability and solvency implication? There is a signiﬁcant and costeﬃcient reuse of solutions, systems and processes from a business in private sector. The margins are attractive, so occupational pensions in public sector is proﬁtable and entering public sector does not dilute the solvency position. To sum up, the combination of a strong value proposition and a large market with high growth and attractive margins gives exciting opportunities. Storebrand is the only new provider that enters this market. Storebrand will achieve capital, customer, and distribution synergies when entering the B2B P&C insurance market. Storebrand has a strong brand name and a broad and attractive product oﬀering across pension and insurance. Storebrand gets group capital synergies through diversiﬁcation due to existing large business volumes in longevity and life insurance risk. We are already in the market and has got a kick start with the transfer of the insured portfolio and expect proﬁtability rather quick. The main ambitions for next year for our business in the corporate markets are market leadership within occupational pension throughout the whole period; building up signiﬁcant business volume in public sector; and ﬁnally, maintain proﬁt level when entering the new individual pension account market.

Good morning, everyone, on this delightful morning in London. Thank you for joining the call. On the call with me are my colleagues, John Pollock, the CEO of Risk; Mark Gregory, the CEO of Savings; and Matt Hotson, our Director of IR and Strategy. I am delighted to share the highlights of another excellent set of results; once again, demonstrating that we're able to grow cash and our businesses at the same time. We did this in 2010, with our best cash and sales figures to date. And we are continuing this in 2011. We are maintaining momentum. We see cash generation as a key metric for Legal & General. Increasingly, it is seen as important by everyone within our industry. And in part, has probably helped to re-rate the sector in 2011. Operational cash for the first three months of the year increased by 25% to GBP248 million. Within this figure, the Q1 dividend received from our US business increased by 10%, to $55 million, or GBP35 million; up from $50 million last year. As we said, it is sustainable and growing. There has been one or two confusing comments in a couple of analysts' notes this morning, on the growth in cash, excluding the US dividend. To clarify, excluding the US dividends, operational cash is up GBP48 million, from GBP165 million to GBP213 million; an increase of 29%. After taking account of new business strain, net cash increased by 18%, to GBP212 million. This reflects a lower positive new business strain in the Annuity business, from lower annuity new business volume. Our cash flow numbers have been achieved by writing new business at lower cost and growing assets under management. We've achieved GBP2 billion of net inflows into LGIM. And GBP0.6 billion into savings, year to date. Worldwide new business APE has grown by 12%, to GBP433 million in the First Quarter. And the stock of assets and premiums, on which operational cash is generated, has continued the trend consistently seen over the last few years. In 2011, we have grown assets in LGIM, Savings, Annuities. And premiums in Protection and the USA by between 7% and 12% per annum. We are ahead of our target to generate GBP700 million of net cash in 2011. Looking at our individual businesses. LGIM's strength as a gatherer and manager of assets is unrivalled. It now manages GBP356 billion of assets; up 8% on last year, GBP330 billion in Q1 of '10. LGIM has attracted GBP2 billion in net inflows. And continues to win index Liability Driven Investments, that's LDI, active fixed income and international client mandates. LDI and International, two big growth markets, increased their proportion of total gross fund flows by 19%. And 22% respectively; up from 15% and 18% in 2010. Mark Gregory and his team are delivering ahead of plan, as the Savings business had a very strong quarter, with total sales up 20%, at GBP320 million of APE, compared to GBP267 million last year; with sales of ISAs and unit trusts up 8%, sales on Investor Portfolio Services, that's IPS, our platform, up 63%. And non-profit workplace pension sales up 103%. The growth in workplace savings has been driven by large schemes which joined in 2010. And new ones in Q1. We expect to see further growth in workplace savings, stimulated by auto enrolment. The Savings business now has GBP65 billion of assets under administration; up 12% on last year. And had net inflows, as we said earlier, of GBP0.6 billion. John can provide more color on the Risk business. Clearly, a good quarter for Housing and Protection. And a quiet quarter for Annuities, where we, once again, showed good financial discipline. In Protection, the housing market remains challenging and mortgage transactions remain below their historic levels. Our strategy of focusing on non-mortgage products, or resilient markets, such as high net worth, business protection. And whole of life for inheritance planning, has resulted in our best quarter of Protection sales since 2008, with growth in APE of 14%, to GBP48 million. This strong sales performance. And good persistency on the in-force book, led to growth in premiums to GBP300 million in the First Quarter. In Annuities, sales were down in individual and BPA, driven by the change in retirement age in Q1 of 2010, which gave a one-off boost to individual annuity sales. In April, though, the BPA market recovered. And we've written around GBP20 million of APE since quarter end. Going forward, as we've said in the past, we believe this market has good long-term growth potential. But it will be lumpy and there will be quarterly volatility in sales. Turning to International. Sales are up 11%, at GBP41 million of APE, compared to GBP37 million last year; driven by very strong USA numbers. We are continuing our US capital management program, where we returned about GBP150 million of capital to Group in 2010; with plans progressing well for more of the same in 2011. Turning now to outlook. We see good growth prospects for the Group in 2011 and beyond. In the UK, a combination of state retrenchment, an aging population, increased household savings and continued de-risking activity by pension fund trustees, will drive growth across Protection, Annuities, Savings and LGIM. So to quickly sum up today's numbers. Worldwide sales are up; operational cash flow is up; and net cash flow is ahead of target. Cash flow is well diversified. And contrary to some market views, cash flow growth is not dependent on positive new business strain in Annuities. L& G is growing. And is well positioned for further growth, as the economic recovery strengthens. And the themes described above play out. We'll be delighted to answer any questions.
