Let me explain the overview of fiscal 2016 results and 2017 projections of Tokio Marine Holdings, which was announced today. In this conference call, I would like to use the PowerPoint material available on our website under News Release & Topics to give you a presentation for the first 25 minutes or so. Then, we will be taking questions afterwards. Now I will start with the overview of fiscal 2016 consolidated results. Please turn to Page three of the PowerPoint material. First is the consolidated results overview. Net premiums written and life premiums are shown on the slide. Consolidated ordinary profit increased year-on-year by 0.5% or by JPY 1.8 billion to JPY 387.6 billion. Net income attributable to owners of the parent increased by 7.6% or by JPY 19.3 billion to JPY 273.8 billion. Adjusted net income, which is a group profit KPI, was JPY 406.7 billion, which is a major increase year-on-year. Next, I will explain the factors related to consolidated ordinary profit. Please turn to Page 4. In the domestic non-life business, underwriting profit increased at Tokyo Marine & Nichido Fire. Net investment income decreased due to reaction from last year's increase in dividend income from overseas subsidiaries related to acquisition of HCC. As a result, ordinary profit declined by JPY 65.5 billion year-on-year. Domestic life business saw decline in ordinary profit due to increase in their business expenses and rebound from reversal of contingency reserve for variable annuities last year. Overseas subsidiaries saw increase in profit due to profit contribution from newly consolidated TMHCC. For consolidation adjustments, negative adjustment decreased due to decrease in dividend payment from consolidated subsidiaries at TMNF, which led to decrease in consolidation adjustment by JPY 54.1 billion year-on-year. Now let me explain about adjusted net income. Please turn to Page 5. Adjusted net income is a group profit KPI based on consolidated net income then excluding factors unique to non-life business such as impact of reserve provisioning as well as gains and losses on sales and valuation of fixed assets in order to understand the underlying profit of the term coming from business activities. Adjusted net income increased by JPY 54.8 billion to JPY 406.7 billion. And adjusted ROE rose by 1.8 points to 11%. Year-on-year changes along the profits of reconciliation from statutory accounting net income to adjusted net income are explained on the slide. Now I will turn to domestic non-life business. Please turn to Page 6. For net premiums written for private lines of insurance, auto insurance increased their top line. But there was an impact coming from fire line of insurance due to shortening of insurance periods, which led to net premiums written of minus 0.7% year-on-year or declined by JPY 12.1 billion. Line-by-line situation is explained on Page 8. Net incurred losses of private insurance decreased by JPY 21 billion due to factors such as decrease in net incurred losses relating to natural catastrophes occurring during the term and reaction from large losses which happened in previous year. Business expenses for private lines of insurance decreased by JPY 1.3 billion year-on-year due to decrease in agency commissions payment coming from net premiums written decline. As for catastrophe loss reserves, mainly due to lowering of the provision rate of auto group, there was decrease in net provision by JPY 50.6 billion year-on-year. As a result, underwriting profit increased by JPY 102.2 billion to be JPY 116.1 billion. Next, I'd like to explain about the investment income. Details on this will be on Page 9. Net investment income decreased by JPY 164.4 billion (sic) JPY 164.6 billion ph to be JPY 197.4 billion due to decrease in dividend income from subsidiaries, decrease in gains and losses of derivatives and gains and losses on sales of securities. Dividend payment from subsidiaries will be almost eliminated by consolidation adjustments. Therefore, there isn't any impact of this to group's consolidated earnings. Business-related equity sold in fiscal 2016 was approximately JPY 117 billion. And gain from the sales was JPY 85 billion. Due to those above-mentioned reasons, net income decreased by JPY 52.9 billion to be JPY 248.6 billion. Next, I will explain about the combined ratio. Please turn to Page 7. In this term, the private insurance lines' E/I loss ratio decreased to 57.7%, decreased by 2.4 points year-on-year, due to decrease in natural catastrophe-related net incurred losses. As for expense ratio, business expenses decreased. However, due to declines in net premiums written, expense ratio went up by 0.1 point to 32.7%. As a result, E/I-based combined ratio lowered by 2.2 points year-on-year to be 90.4%. Now I will explain about Nisshin Fire insurance company. Please turn to Page 10. As for the underwriting profits of Nisshin Fire, although there is an impact as a reaction to catastrophe loss reserves which was reversed last year, net premiums written increased and net incurred losses related to natural catastrophes decreased. As a result, underwriting profit increased by JPY 0.2 billion year-on-year to JPY 8.1 billion. As for net investment income and other, mainly due to decline in interest and dividend income, it declined by JPY 0.7 billion year-on-year to be JPY 1.2 billion. As for net income after reflecting corporate tax payment, net income increased by JPY 0.4 billion year-onyear to be JPY 6.5 billion. Next, I would like to talk about Tokio Marine & Nichido Life Insurance, Co. Please turn to Page 11. New policies ANP was flat year-on-year while, excluding long-term savings products, we saw favorable sales with household income term product and increase in policies due to last-minute demand before the revision of the standard interest rate. New policies ANP increased by 13%. For in-force policies ANP, due to steady increase in new policy sales, it grew by 4.4% year-on-year. Now I'll explain about financial accounting. Net income decreased by JPY 5.9 billion yearon-year to JPY 8.7 billion. This is due to increase in business expenses for systems investment expense and reaction to reversal of contingency reserve associated with surrender in variable annuities last year in addition to decreasing gains on sales of securities. As for core operating profit, which excludes reaction from reversal of contingency reserve and decreasing gains on sales of securities, it decreased by JPY 2.7 billion year-on-year to JPY 22.3 billion. Now I'd like to explain about International insurance business. Please turn to Page 12. In the International insurance business, net premiums written increased by 27% year-on-year due to the contribution of TMHCC and steady progress of various growth initiatives. On local currency terms, excluding the impact of the appreciation of Japanese yen, the business grew by 32% year-on-year. To break this down by region North America achieved positive growth, thanks to the contribution of TMHCC. Philadelphia and Delphi also grew their top lines due to rate increases in renewal book as well as growth of new business. Europe also grew on a localcurrency basis due to the expansion of business in Tokio Marine Kiln. However, due to the appreciation of Japanese yen, net premiums written decreased in yen terms. South and Central America as well as Asia grew, driven by the growth of auto business. Reinsurance declined primarily because of the rebound effect of increased sales of multiyear policies booked in FY '15. Life insurance business grew thanks to sales growth, particularly in Singapore and Thailand. Next, let me discuss business unit profit of International insurance business. Please turn to Page 13. Business unit profit grew by 29% or JPY 37.6 billion over the year, also due to the contribution of TMHCC and steady progress of growth initiatives. On the local-currency basis, excluding the impact of the appreciation of Japanese yen, profit grew by 34% yearon-year. By region, the business profit of North America increased thanks to the contribution of TMHCC. Europe and reinsurance also grew positively, mainly due to the absence of impact of large losses and foreign exchange gains recorded in FY '15. Meanwhile, in South and Central America and in Asia, the business unit profit declined due to large losses. For more details about 3 group companies in North America, please refer to Page 14 at your convenience. Next, I will explain business unit profit for the entire group on Page 15. Business unit profit is a KPI that we use in order to understand corporate value of the respective businesses. Different from adjusted net income, business unit profit does not include dividend from group companies and sales gains of business-related equities. Also, to reflect the contribution of life insurance business, we take into account the growth of EV ph in the calculation. Business unit profit of domestic non-life business increased by JPY 41.6 billion year-onyear to JPY 167.6 billion due to the factors listed on the slide. Domestic life grew by JPY 561.6 billion from a year ago to JPY 373.5 billion, primarily due to the changes of definitions in the measurement method of MCEV in addition to the impact of rise in interest rates. And International insurance business grew by JPY 37.6 billion to JPY 169.5 billion, as I just discussed. This concludes the overview of FY '16 financial results. Let me now discuss projections for FY '17. Please turn to Page 18. This is the overview of our consolidated projections for FY '17. Based on the net premiums written and life insurance premiums described on the slide, we project our consolidated ordinary profit to increase by JPY 17.3 billion over the year to JPY 405 billion. And net income attributable to owners of the parent is expected to grow by JPY 6.1 billion year-on-year to JPY 280 billion. Adjusted net income is projected to decline by JPY 24.7 billion to JPY 382 billion due to the expected decrease in sales gains of business-related equities and dividend income in the domestic non-life business as well as currency impact in the International insurance business. Next, to review how the consolidated ordinary profit is expected to move, please refer to Page 19. Profit in the domestic non-life business is expected to grow by JPY 24 billion over the year to JPY 345.5 billion due to the expected increase in underwriting profit and net investment income and other at TMNF. Domestic life business is projected to grow its profit by JPY 21.2 billion over the year to JPY 34.5 billion. And International insurance business is also expected to grow by JPY 4.1 billion to 100 -- or expected to decline by JPY 4.1 billion to JPY 170 billion. In the consolidated adjustments, negative adjustment is expected to increase by JPY 23.2 billion due to the projected increase in TMNF dividend income received from consolidated subsidiaries, while goodwill amortization is expected to decline due to appreciation of Japanese yen. Next, to review our guidance on adjusted net profit, please turn to Page 20. Adjusted net income is projected to decline by JPY 24.7 billion from a year ago to JPY 382 billion, with the adjusted ROE of 9.8% down by 1.2 points year-on-year. For more details about reconciliation from net income under JGAAP to adjusted net income and major differences from the previous year, please refer to the table on the slide. Next, to review domestic non-life business, please refer to Page 21. Net premiums written of private lines of business are projected to increase, mainly driven by auto insurance business. Net incurred losses are expected to go up by JPY 14.1 billion due to the expected increase in top line as well as the rebound effect of few large losses recorded in FY '16. Provision for cat loss reserves is expected to decrease by JPY 9.3 billion year-onyear, mainly due to the expected increase in takedown from the reserve in the auto business associated with the rise of loss ratio on written paid basis. All in all, underwriting profit is expected to increase by JPY 13.8 billion year-on-year to JPY 130 billion. Net investment income and other is projected to increase by JPY 10.7 billion to JPY 208.2 billion due to the expected increase in dividend income from subsidiaries. Based on these factors as well as expected decrease in extraordinary gains and losses, net income is projected to grow by JPY 21.3 billion to JPY 270 billion. Next, for Nisshin Fire, please refer to Page 24. At Nisshin Fire, net income is projected to decline by JPY 2 billion to JPY 4.5 billion due to the expected increase in net incurred losses associated with the rise of unit repair cost in the auto business as well as an average level of nat cat losses that we're assuming for a normal year. Next, for TMNL, please go to Page 25. ANP of new policies is projected to decline by 24.2% year-on-year due to the suspended sales of long-term saving-type products as well as product revisions in conjunction with the revision of the standard interest rate despite our efforts to promote the sales of living benefit products. In the meantime, on the JGAAP basis, net income is expected to increase by JPY 15.1 billion year-on-year to JPY 23.9 billion. And core operating profit is projected to grow by JPY 12.1 billion to JPY 34.5 billion due to the product revisions associated with the revised standard discount rate as well as expected decrease in provision for policy reserves based on suspended sales of long-term saving-type products. Next, to review International insurance business, please turn to Page 26. In the International insurance business, net premiums written is projected to decline by JPY 12.4 billion to JPY 1,642,000,000,000 because of the expected impact of stronger Japanese yen, while we are expecting growth on a local-currency basis based on the advancement of various growth initiatives that we are promoting. Next, for business unit profit of International insurance business, please go to Page 27. Business unit profit is expected to decline by JPY 16.5 billion year-on-year because of stronger Japanese yen, average level of nat cats in a normal year that we are assuming as well as the rebound effect of foreign currency gains recorded in FY '16. However, after normalizing these factors, the profit is expected to grow by 4% positively against the actual FY '16 as the underlying profit trend is favorable, primarily in Asia, Europe and reinsurance. Detailed projections for 3 group companies in North America and business unit profits for the entire group are described on Page 28 and 29, respectively, for your reference. Last but not least, let us share with you our ESR. Please go to Page 31. In calculating ESR, Tokio Marine measures risk based on 99.95% VaR for AA calibration and exclude restricted capital while we refer to the method of Solvency II in Europe. To review where our ESR stands at the moment, please refer to Page 32. This slide shows how our ESR changed from the end of September 2016 to the end of March 2017. As of the end of March 2017, our ESR increased by -- increased to 139% due to the increase in net asset value and decrease in risk capital. Net asset value became JPY 3.5 trillion due to the increase in unrealized gains of business-related equities in addition to the contribution of adjusted net income in the second half. Meanwhile, risk capital decreased to JPY 2.5 trillion, mainly due to the decrease in interest rate risk associated with the rise in interest rates as well as sales of business-related equities. Please also note that we are newly disclosing the impact of market changes on our ESR at this particular timing of the year. This concludes my presentation. And we would now like to open the floor to entertain your questions.

1334,Kiyoshi Wada,20170519_TOKIO_MARINE_HD-_Earnings_Call_2017-5-19_FS000000002351735615.pdf,2017-05-19,9.0,1,0,TOKIO MARINE," 19963983  My name is Wada from IR Group of Tokio Marine Holdings. Let me explain the overview of fiscal 2016 results and 2017 projections of Tokio Marine Holdings which was announced today. In this conference call, I would like to use the PowerPoint material available on our website under New Release and Topics to give you a presentation for the first 25 minutes or so. Then we will be taking questions afterwards. Now, I will start with the overview of fiscal 2016 consolidated results. Please turn to page 3 of the PowerPoint material. First is the consolidated results overview. Net premiums written and life premiums are as shown on the slide. Consolidated ordinary profit increased year-on-year by 0.5% or by ¥1.8 billion to ¥387.6 billion. Net income attributable to owners of the parent increased by 7.6% or by ¥19.3 billion to ¥273.8 billion. Adjusted net income, which is a group profit KPI, was ¥406.7 billion, which is a major increase year-onyear. Next, I will explain the factors related to consolidated ordinary profit. Please turn to page 4. In the Domestic Non-Life business, underwriting profit increased at Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire. Net investment income decreased due to reaction from last year's increase in dividend income from overseas subsidiaries related to acquisition of HCC. As a result, ordinary profit declined by ¥65.5 billion year-on-year. Domestic Life business saw a decline in ordinary profit due to increase in their business expenses and rebound from reversal of contingency reserve for variable annuities last year. Overseas subsidiaries saw increase in profit due to profit contribution from newly consolidated TMHCC. For consolidated adjustments, negative adjustment decreased due to decrease in dividend payment from consolidated subsidiaries of TMNF, which led to decrease in consolidation adjustment by ¥54.1 billion year-on-year. Now, let me explain about adjusted net income. Please turn to page 5. Adjusted net income is a group profit KPI based on consolidated net income, then excluding factors unique to Non-Life business, such as impact of reserve provisioning, as well as gains and losses on sales and valuation of fixed assets in order to understand the underlying profit of the term coming from business activities. Adjusted net income increased by ¥54.8 billion to ¥406.7 billion and adjusted ROE rose by 1.8 points to 11%. Year-on-year changes along the process of reconciliation from statutory accounting net income to adjusted net income are explained on the slide. Now, I will turn to Domestic Non-Life business. Please turn to page 6. For net premiums written for private lines of insurance, auto insurance increased their top line. But there was an impact coming from fire line of insurance due to shortening of insurance period, which led to net premiums written of minus 0.7% year-on-year or a decline by ¥12.1 billion. Line-by-line situation is explained on page 8. Net incurred losses of private insurance decreased by ¥21 billion due to factors such as decrease in net incurred losses relating to natural catastrophes occurring during the term and reaction from large losses which happened in previous year. Business expenses for private lines of insurance decreased by ¥1.3 billion year-on-year due to decrease in agency commission payment coming from net premiums written decline. As for catastrophe loss reserve, mainly due to lowering of the provision rate of auto group, there was decrease in net provision by ¥50.6 billion year-on-year. As a result, underwriting profit increased by ¥102.2 billion to be ¥116.1 billion. Next, I'd like to explain about the investment income. Details of this will be on page 9. Net investment income decreased by ¥164.4 billion to be ¥197.4 billion due to decrease in dividend income from subsidiaries, decreasing gains and losses on derivatives, and gains and losses on sales of securities. Dividend payment from subsidiaries will be almost eliminated by consolidation adjustment. Therefore, there isn't any impact of this to group's consolidated earnings. Business-related equity sold in fiscal 2016 was approximately ¥117 billion and gain from the sales was ¥85 billion. Due to those above mentioned reasons, net income decreased by ¥52.9 billion to be ¥248.6 billion. Next, I will explain about the combined ratio, please turn to page 7. In this term, the private insurance lines E/I loss ratio decreased to 57.7%, decreased by 2.4 points year-onyear due to decrease in natural catastrophe-related net incurred losses. As for expense ratio, business expenses decreased, however, due to decline in net premiums written, expense ratio went up by 0.1 point to 32.7%. As a result, E/I basis combined ratio lowered by 2.2 points year-on-year to be 90.4%. Now, I will explain about Nisshin Fire Insurance Company. Please turn to page 10. As for the underwriting profit of Nisshin Fire, although there is an impact of reaction to catastrophe loss reserve, which was reversed last year, net premiums written increased and net incurred losses related to natural catastrophes decreased. As a result, underwriting profit increased by ¥0.2 billion year-on-year to ¥8.1 billion. As for net investment income and other, mainly due to decline in interest and dividend income, it declined by ¥0.7 billion year-on-year to be ¥1.2 billion. As for net income, after reflecting corporate tax payment, net income increased by ¥0.4 billion year-on-year to be ¥6.5 billion. Next, I would like to talk about Tokio Marine & Nichido Life Insurance Company. Please turn to page 11. New policies ANP was flat year-on-year, while excluding long-term saving products, we saw favorable sales with household income term product and increase in policies due to last minute demand before the revision of the standard interest rate, new policies ANP increased by 13%. For in-force policies ANP, due to steady increase in new policy sales, grew by 4.4% year-on-year. Now, I will explain about financial accounting. Net income decreased by ¥5.9 billion yearon-year to ¥8.7 billion. This is due to increase in business expenses for systems investment expense and reaction to reversal of contingency reserve associated with surrender in variable annuities last year in addition to a decrease in gains on sales of securities. As for core operating profit, which excludes reaction from reversal of contingency reserve and a decrease in gains on sales of securities, it decreased by ¥2.7 billion year-on-year to ¥22.3 billion. Now, I'd like to explain about International Insurance business. Please turn to page 12. In the International Insurance business, net premiums written increased by 27% year-on-year due to the contribution of TMHCC and steady progress of various growth initiatives. On a local currency terms, excluding the impact of the appreciation of Japanese yen, the business grew by 32% year-on-year. To break this down by region, North America achieved positive growth, thanks to the contribution of TMHCC. Philadelphia and Delphi also grew their top line due to rate increases in renewal book, as well as growth of new business. Europe also grew on a local currency basis due to the expansion of business in Tokio Marine Kiln. However, due to the appreciation of Japanese yen, net premiums written decreased in yen term. South and Central America, as well as Asia grew, driven by the growth of auto business. Reinsurance declined primarily because of the rebound effect of increased sales of multi-year policies booked in FY 2015. Life Insurance business grew, thanks to sales growth particularly in Singapore and Thailand. Next, let me discuss business unit profit of International Insurance business. Please turn to page 13. Business unit profit grew by 29% or ¥37.6 billion over the year, also due to the contribution of TMHCC and steady progress of growth initiatives. On a local currency basis, excluding the impact of the appreciation of Japanese yen, the profit grew by 34% year-on-year. By region, the business profit of North America increased, thanks to the contribution of TMHCC. Europe and reinsurance also grew positively, mainly due to the absence of impact of large losses and foreign exchange gains recorded in FY 2015. Meanwhile, in South and Central America and in Asia, the business unit profit declined due to large losses. For more details about three group companies in North America, please refer to page 14 at your convenience. Next, I will explain business unit profit for the entire group on page 15. Business unit profit is a KPI that we use in order to understand corporate value of the respective businesses. Different from adjusted net income, business unit profit does not include dividend from group companies and self-gains of business-related equity. Also, to reflect the contribution of Life Insurance business, we take into account the growth of EV in the calculation. Business unit profit of Domestic Non-Life business increased by ¥41.6 billion year-on-year to ¥167.6 billion due to the factors listed on the slide. Domestic Life grew by ¥561.6 billion from a year ago to ¥373.5 billion primarily due to the changes of definitions in the measurement method of MCEV in addition to the impact of rise in interest rate. And International Insurance business grew by ¥37.6 billion to ¥169.5 billion as I just discussed. This includes the overview of FY 2016 financial results. Let me now discuss projections for FY 2017. Please turn to page 18. This is the overview of our consolidated projections for FY 2017. Based on the net premiums written and life insurance premium described on the slide, we project our consolidated ordinary profit to increase by ¥17.3 billion over the year to ¥405 billion. And net income attributable to owners of the parent is expected to grow by ¥6.1 billion year-on-year to ¥280 billion. Adjusted net income is projected to decline by ¥24.7 billion to ¥382 billion due to the expected decrease in sales gains of business-related equities and dividend income in the Domestic Non-Life business as well as currency impact in the International Insurance business. Next to review, how the consolidated ordinary profit is expected to move, please refer to page 19. Profit in the Domestic Non-Life business is expected to grow by ¥24 billion over the year to ¥345.5 billion due to the expected increase in underwriting profit and net investment income and other at TMNF. Domestic Life business is projected to grow its profit by ¥21.2 billion over the year to ¥34.5 billion and International Insurance business is also expected to grow by ¥4.1 billion – is expected to decline by ¥4.1 billion to ¥170 billion. In the consolidated adjustments, negative adjustment is expected to increase by ¥23.2 billion due to the projected increase in TMNF dividend income received from consolidated subsidiaries, while goodwill amortization is expected to decline due to appreciation of Japanese yen. Next, to review our guidance on adjusted net profit, please turn to page 20. Adjusted net income is projected to decline by ¥24.7 billion from a year ago to ¥382 billion with the adjusted ROE of 9.8%, down by 1.2 point year-on-year. For more details about reconciliation from net income under JGAAP to adjusted net income and major differences from the previous year, please refer to the table on the slide. Next, to review, Domestic Non-Life business, please refer to page 21. Net premiums written of private lines of business are projected to increase, mainly driven by auto insurance business. Net incurred losses are expected to go up by ¥14.1 billion due to the expected increase in top line, as well as the rebound effect of few large losses recorded in FY 2016. Provision for a cat loss reserve is expected to decrease by ¥9.3 billion year-on-year, mainly due to the expected increase in takedown from the reserve in the auto business associated with the rise of loss ratio on the written paid basis. All-in-all, underwriting profit is expected to increase by ¥13.8 billion year-on-year to ¥130 billion. Net investment income and other is projected to increase by ¥10.7 billion to ¥208.2 billion due to the expected increase in dividend income from subsidiaries. Based on these factors, as well as expected decrease in extraordinary gains and losses, net income is projected to grow by ¥21.3 billion to ¥270 billion. Next, for Nisshin Fire, please refer to page 24. At Nisshin Fire, net income is projected to decline by ¥2 billion to ¥4.5 billion due to the expected increase in net incurred losses associated with the rise of unit repair cost in the auto business, as well as an average level of net cat losses that we are assuming for a normal year. Next, for TMNL, please go to page 25. ANP of new policies is projected to decline by 24.2% year-on-year due to the suspended sales of long-term saving-type products as well as product revisions in conjunction with the revision of the standard interest rate despite our efforts to promote the sales of living benefit products. In the meantime, on the JGAAP basis, net income is expected to increase by ¥15.1 billion year-on-year to ¥23.9 billion, and core operating profit is projected to grow by ¥12.1 billion to ¥34.5 billion due to the product revisions associated with the revised standard discount rate as well as expected decrease in provision for quality reserve based on suspended sales of long-term saving-type products. Next, to review International Insurance business, please turn to page 26. In the International Insurance business, net premiums written is projected to decline by ¥12.4 billion to ¥1.642 trillion because of the expected impact of stronger Japanese yen, while we are expecting growth on the local currency basis based on the advancement of various growth initiatives that we are promoting. Next, for the business unit profit of International Insurance business, please go to page 27. Business unit profit is expected to decline by ¥16.5 billion year-on-year because of stronger Japanese yen, average level of nat cats in a normal year that we are assuming as well as the rebound impact of foreign currency gains recorded in FY 2016. However, after normalizing these factors, the profit is expected to grow by 4% possibly against the actual FY 2016 as the underlying profit trend is favorable primarily in Asia, Europe and reinsurance. Detailed projections for three group companies in North America, and business unit profit for the entire group are described on page 28 and 29, respectively, for your reference. Last but not least, let us share with you our ESR. Please go to page 31. In calculating ESR, Tokio Marine measures risks based on 99.95% VaR for AA calibration and exclude restricted capital while we refer to the method of Solvency II in Europe. To review where our ESR stands at the moment, please refer to page 32. This slide shows how our ESR changed from the end of September 2016 to the end of March 2017. As of the end of March 2017, our ESR increased to 139% due to the increase in net asset value and decrease in risk capital. Net asset value became ¥3.5 trillion due to the increase in unrealized gains of business-related equities in addition to the contribution of adjusted net income in the second half. Meanwhile, risk capital decreased to ¥2.5 trillion, mainly due to the decrease in interest rate risk associated with the rise in interest rate as well as sales of business-related equities. Please also note that we are newly disclosing the impact of market changes on our ESR at this particular timing of the year. This concludes my presentation. And we would now like to open the floor to entertain your questions.

1333,Kiyoshi Wada,20160809_TOKIO_MARINE_HD-_Earnings_Call_2016-8-9_FS000000002298049534.pdf,2016-08-09,9.0,1,0,TOKIO MARINE," 19963983  I am Kiyoshi Wada from Corporate Communications and Investor Relations Group. I would like to give you the overview of Tokio Marine Holdings' financial results during the first quarter of FY 2016, that we announced today. I would like to give you a presentation for the first 15 minutes or so, based on the PowerPoint slides uploaded on our website under Topics. After my presentation, we would like to entertain your questions. Let me start with the overview of our consolidated results on page two. Net premiums written were ¥894.4 billion, up by 6.3% or ¥53.1 billion year-on-year, primarily due to the contribution of newly consolidated HCC despite the appreciation of Japanese yen. Insurance premium, Domestic and International Life Insurance business totaled ¥215 billion, up by ¥206.6 billion due to an increase in in-force policies and decrease in surrender of variable annuities. Consolidated ordinary profit went up by 1.6% or ¥2 billion year-on-year to ¥128 billion. Net income attributable to owners of the parent increased by 8.7% or ¥7.7 billion over the year to ¥97.2 billion. I will amplify on the details about the consolidated ordinary profit later. After excluding the effects of provisions for cat loss reserves and amortization of goodwill associated with HCC consolidation, adjusted net income increased by ¥2.8 billion year-on-year to ¥125 billion. Next, let us review how the consolidated ordinary profit changed from a year ago on page three. In the Domestic P&C business, ordinary profit of TMNF increased by ¥21.8 billion year-on-year due to increase in underwriting profit and net investment income and other. Underwriting profit increased mainly due to increase of earned premiums and decrease in provision for cat loss reserves, while the net losses incurred by nat cat increased. As for net investment income and other, dividend from domestic subsidiaries and business-related equities decreased, but self-gains of securities increased. Ordinary profit of Nisshin Fire dropped by ¥3 billion, mainly due to increase in provision for underwriting reserves. As a result, ordinary profit of Domestic Non-Life in total grew by ¥18.7 billion year-on-year. Profit of Domestic Life business increased by ¥4.4 billion yearon-year due to decrease in provision for underwriting reserves and improvement in gains and losses on sales of securities. Ordinary profit of International Insurance business declined by ¥10.3 billion year-on-year. So, HCC was newly consolidated to contribute to our P&L, profit declined due to stronger Japanese yen as well as capital losses on bonds realized by Delphi. As for consolidation adjustments, negative adjustment increased by ¥10.5 billion year-on-year due to an increase in amortization of goodwill associated with HCC consolidation. Next, please turn to page four to review adjusted net income. Adjusted net income is a group-wide KPI based on consolidated net income under J-GAAP, but compensating for the impact of various reserves unique to insurance business and deducting sales gains and losses of fixed assets in order to indicate the underlying profit and loss from our business operations. Major changes over the year in the reconciliation from net income under J-GAAP to adjusted net income are shown on the slide. Adjusted net income increased by ¥2.8 billion year-on-year to ¥125 billion. Sales of business-related equities progressed ahead of the annual plan, and we have already achieved approximately 32% of the full-year adjusted net income, which is projected to be ¥388 billion for FY 2016. Next, I will discuss Domestic Non-Life business on page five. This is the overview of the FY 2016 Q1 results of TMNF. We explained in more detail about underwriting profit first. Net premiums written for private lines of business increased by 0.6% or ¥2.9 billion in total. While premium for fire business decreased due to the shortening of the contract durations, the number of auto policies increased and effects of the historical product and rate provisions came through. For more details by line of business, please refer to page seven later. Net losses incurred on the private lines of business increased by ¥11.4 billion year-on-year, despite the decrease in the provision for outstanding reserves for foreign currencydenominated claims, associated with the appreciation of Japanese yen. Main factors behind the increase in net incurred losses are described on the slide, but the biggest reason is the increase in nat cat losses in the commercial business due to Kumamoto earthquake. Provision for cat loss reserves decreased by ¥14.3 billion year-on-year mainly due to the reduction of the provision rate in the auto business. As a result, underwriting profit of a term under review increased by ¥16.3 billion year-on-year to ¥36.4 billion. Excluding the impact of cat loss reserve, underwriting profit was ¥54.1 billion, up by ¥2 billion year-onyear. Next. Net investment income and other. Details are described on page eight, but while dividend from domestic subsidiaries and business-related equities decreased, sales gains of securities increased. As a result, net investment income and other increased by ¥7.7 billion to ¥78.6 billion. I would also like to note that during the first quarter, we sold business-related equities by approximately ¥52 billion, and the sales gains were approximately ¥38 billion. Based from the procurement that I explained so far, as well as increase in sales gains for fixed assets, all in all, we recorded a net income of ¥92 billion, up by ¥23 billion year-on-year. Next. Let me discuss combined ratio on page six. The private insurance, earned-incurred basis loss ratio increased by 0.9 points year-on-year to 55.4%, mainly due to an increase in net-incurred losses relating to natural catastrophe. The impact of natural catastrophes was 4.5 points per quarter compared to 1.5 points in Q1 last fiscal year. Hence, the loss ratio excluding the natural catastrophe impact was better year-on-year. The expense ratio improved by 0.4 points year-on-year to 32.2% mainly due to a decrease in personnel expenses. As a result, the combined ratio for private insurance on a earned-incurred basis increased 0.4 points year-on-year to 87.6%. Next, I will go through the financial results for Nisshin Fire. Please turn to page nine. For Nisshin Fire, although net premiums written increase driven by fire and auto insurance due to an increase in net provision for underwriting reserves and an increase in net incurred losses including natural catastrophes, underwriting profit decreased by ¥2.4 billion yearon-year to ¥1.7 billion. Net investment income decreased by ¥0.4 billion year-on-year to below zero due to a decrease in interest and dividends income. As a result, net income decreased by ¥2 billion year-on-year to ¥1.1 billion. Next, I will explain the results for TMNL, please turn to page 10. New policies ANP decreased by 15% year-on-year due to limiting the sales of long-term savings type products. However, excluding long-term saving type products, our core focus and the medium-term management plan, new policies ANP increased by 16.2% year-on-year due to favorable sales in third sector lines such as medical and cancer insurance. In-force policies ANP increased by 4.9% year-on-year due to an increase in new policies. Excluding the impact of variable annuities, in-force ANP increased by 11% year-on-year. Regarding key figures in financial accounting, as you can see on the slide, net income increased by ¥3.1 billion year-on-year to ¥6.2 billion due to a decrease in net provision for underwriting reserve as well as an improvement in gains and losses on sales of securities. Core operating profit increased by ¥1 billion year-on-year to ¥7.2 billion. Next, I'll talk about the international insurance business on page 11. Net premiums written for the international insurance business increased by 23% year-on-year to ¥429.5 billion due to contribution from HCC that has been newly consolidated from this fiscal year. By region, net premiums written decreased in some regions due to the appreciation of the yen. But on a local currency basis (1333) recorded an uptick including Europe and Life. In North America, net premiums written increased by 49% due to HCC (1345) sales and Philadelphia and Delphi contributing rate increases in the renewal book and an increase in new business. In emerging countries such as Brazil, India and Thailand, auto insurance sales growth continued and reinsurance increased mainly in the non-catastrophe business. Next, I'll talk about business unit profit for the International Insurance Business on page 12. Business unit profit increased by ¥2 billion year-on-year to (1428) billion. Due to contributions from each business segment, progress made in Q1 compared to fiscal year projections came in line at 25%. Next, I will give details by region. America profits by ¥1.4 billion. Delphi realized capital losses on bonds with the aim of risk reduction. However, HCC's earnings contribution, Philadelphia's business profit and Delphi increased in interest and dividend income contributed positively. South and Central America and Asia profits decreased respectively by 57% and 69% due to the impact of large losses and others. Profits for Europe and Reinsurance on the other hand increased due to foreign exchange gains. Life increased mainly due to an increase of unrealized gains on bonds due to a decline in interest rates in Singapore and Thailand. Details for Philadelphia, Delphi and HCC are provided on page 13. This concludes my presentation. We'd now like to take any questions that you may have. Thank you.

Let me explain the overview of fiscal 2015 results, and fiscal 2016 projections of Tokio Marine Holdings, which was announced today. We will mainly use the PowerPoint document that can be found on the top page of our website to give you a presentation for the first 30 minutes. Afterwards, we will have a Q&A session. Please turn to page three of the presentation material. First, I will explain about the consolidated results overview. Net premiums written was ¥3,265.5 billion year-on-year, plus 4.4% or increase by ¥137.9 billion. This is mainly because of increase in premium income at domestic P&C business centering around also on fire insurances, as well as expansion of underwriting of International Insurance business. Next, life premiums of domestic and international life business was ¥471.6 billion, year-on-year, plus 114% or an increase by ¥251.2 billion. Life premium increased because of increase in in-force policies at TMNL, as well as because of less surrender of variable annuities formerly sold by Financial Life. Ordinary profit was, year-on-year, 7.7% increased by ¥27.6 billion or ¥385.8 billion. Net income attributable to owners of the parent was, year-on-year, plus 2.9% or increase by ¥7.1 billion to ¥254.5 billion. We will explain more about the consolidated ordinary profit in more details later on. Adjusted net income, which is KPI for the group total, is calculated by taking financial accounting basis net profit, then deducting impact such as additional provisioning to catastrophe loss reserve. Adjusted net income of the term was plus 8.8% year-on-year or increase by ¥28.6 billion or ¥351.9 billion. Next, I will explain about the factors influencing consolidated ordinary profit. Please turn to page four. In domestic P&C business, at Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire, there was a decline in underwriting profit but increase in net investment income, ordinary profit increased by ¥113.1 billion. As for underwriting income, net premiums earned increased, but at the same time there was increase in net incurred losses related to natural catastrophes, higher large losses and increase in net provision to catastrophe loss reserve leading to decline in underwriting profit. Nisshin Fire, however, there was increase in the dividend income, and there was an improvement in the gain from the derivatives, and the sales coming from the security sales, which led to increase. Nisshin Fire saw increase in net premiums earned, but some increase in net incurred losses related to natural catastrophes and net provision for catastrophe loss reserve, its ordinary profit was a decline by ¥7.9 billion. Due to the above mentioned reasons, domestic P&C business overall had increased in ordinary profit by ¥105.2 billion. In Domestic Life business, we saw a reversal of contingency reserve associated with surrender of variable annuities. Other results, ordinary profit increased by ¥8.3 billion yearon-year. In overseas subsidiaries, there was decrease in net incurred losses relating to natural catastrophes. However, there was some large losses and foreign exchange losses in addition to the appreciation of yen against emerging market currencies leading to decline in ordinary profit by ¥9.4 billion. For consolidation adjustment, amount of negative adjustment increased by ¥75.9 billion year-on-year. This is because of increase in intra-group dividend payment from consolidated subsidiaries at Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire, which led to increase in consolidation elimination. Let me now explain about the adjusted net income. Please turn to page five. Adjusted net income is based on the financial net income at the time of each financial settlement, and is adjusted by excluding various reserves such as catastrophe loss reserve, which is unique to P&C business, as well as excluding gains or losses on sales or valuation of fixed asset. It serves as (0604) profits KPI showing profit generated by business activities of the term. Adjusted net income of the term increased by ¥28.6 billion year-on-year to ¥351.9 billion. Adjusted ROE improved by 0.2 points versus last term to 9.1%. Major factors of changes in adjusted net income year-on-year were improvement of gain and losses on derivatives, and an increase in gains on sales of securities, despite an increase in net incurred losses mainly related to natural catastrophes in Domestic Non-Life business. At overseas subsidiaries, there were large losses and also FX losses. Reconciliation from net income to adjusted net income and the differences from last term are as shown on the slide. Next, I will explain about the Domestic Non-Life insurance business. Please turn to page six. I will start from underwriting profits and refer to the important factors. For net premiums written, all lines of insurance increased their top lines centering around auto and fire lines of insurances. Net premiums written for private insurance increased 4.8% or up by ¥85.1 billion. Situation over each line of business is explained on page eight. Please refer to page eight later. Net incurred losses of private insurance increased by ¥77.3 billion, and major factors are as described on the slide. Business expenses increased by ¥34.2 billion due to increase in agency commissions associated with revenue growth. Additional provisioning of catastrophe loss reserve increased by ¥28.6 billion year-on-year due to the improvement of written-to-paid (0810) loss ratio in auto insurance. As a result, underwriting profit for the term decreased by ¥46 billion or ¥13.8 billion. Underwriting profit, excluding the impacts of catastrophe loss reserve was a decline by ¥17.3 billion year-on-year or ¥107.4 billion. Next, I will talk about net investment income and others. Mainly due to the increase in dividend payment from overseas subsidiaries, improvement on gains and losses and derivatives, and increase on gains from sales of securities, net investment income increased by ¥159.4 billion to be ¥352 billion. The business-related equities sold in fiscal 2015 was approximately ¥122 billion, and gain from the sale was ¥90 billion. Due to the abovementioned reasons, net income increased by ¥116.2 billion to be ¥301.6 billion. Next, I will explain about the combined ratio. Please turn to page seven. In fiscal 2015, mainly due to the increase in natural catastrophes related claims payment, private insurance E/I loss ratio increased by 1.6 points to 60.1%. Impact of the natural catastrophes last term was 1.6 points, whereas this term, it was 4.1 points. Loss ratio excluding natural catastrophes factor improved compared to last year. As for expense ratio, despite the improvement seen from the increase in net premiums written, we saw increase in average agency commission rate associated with an increase in policies with higher commission rate, and increase in corporate expenses due to system cost for strengthening the business platform. Expense ratio went up from previous year by 0.4% to 32.6%. As a result, E/I combined ratio increased by 2 points to 92.7%. On page eight, we are showing the line-by-line premium and loss ratio situation. On page nine, we are showing the details of asset management results. Please refer to those pages later. Now, I will explain about Nisshin Fire Insurance Company, please turn to page 10. Nisshin Fire saw increase in net premiums written mainly for auto. At the same time, there was increase in net incurred losses related to natural catastrophes, and decline in amount of reversal in fire insurance. As a result, underwriting profits decreased by ¥6.8 billion yearon-year to ¥7.8 billion. As for net investment income and others, mainly due to increase in impairment losses on securities, net investment income decreased by ¥0.6 billion yearon-year to ¥1.9 billion. Net income of the term declined by ¥6.4 billion year-on-year to ¥6.1 billion, mainly due to the reasons for decline in underwriting income. Next, I will explain about Tokio Marine & Nichido Life Insurance Company. Please turn to page 11. First, I will explain about the annualized premiums or ANP. As for new policies ANP, while we limited the sales of long-term savings products, we saw favorable sales in the third-sector line owing to new products such as medical and cancer products. New policies ANP increased by 18.3%. Excluding the long-term savings-type policies, it was an increase by 13.8%. For in-force policies ANP, due to the favorable market condition in the first half of the year, we saw some surrender and lump-sum payment upon reaching target in variable annuities, while we achieved increase in new policies which led to increase in inforce policies ANP by 4.2%. Excluding variable annuities, it was an increase by 12.4% yearon-year. Now, I'll explain about financial accounting. As for the net income, there was a reversal of contingency reserves associated with surrender of variable annuities, and reaction effect due to the recording of deferred tax assets of Financial Life, which was not formerly done. Net income decreased by ¥14 billion year-on-year to ¥14.7 billion. It was in line with the annual projection for the term. As for core operating profit, it decreased by ¥0.4 billion year-on-year to ¥25 billion. Now, I'll explain about International Insurance business. Please turn to page 12. Net premiums written from the International Insurance business was flat year-on-year at ¥1,304 billion due to emerging market currencies. Excluding the FX effects, it increased by 6% year-on-year due to the progress of growth measures in each business segment. Let me explain about each region. North America increased its top line by 5% due to rate increase of renewal book, and increase in new business book at Philadelphia and Delphi. Europe, on local-currency basis, had increased its top line due to business expansion at Tokio Marine Kiln, however, had decrease in net premiums written by 2% in yen terms due to FX effect. South America and Central America had brisk auto insurance sales in Brazil in local-currency terms. But in yen terms, top line dropped by 22% due to FX effect. Asia had increase in top line due to brisk auto insurance sales in India and China in local-currency basis, but in yen terms, top line dropped by 3% due to FX effect. Reinsurance business increased its net premiums written by 26% mainly by expanding underwriting in noncatastrophe business and multi-year policies. In life business, net premiums written decreased by 30% mainly due to suspension of sales of the specific products in Singapore. Next, I will explain about the business unit profit of International Insurance business. Please turn to page 13. Business unit profit of International Insurance business declined by ¥13.7 billion year-over-year to ¥131.8 billion due to several large losses, foreign exchange losses, and depreciation of emerging market currency, despite a decrease in natural cat losses. But we still achieved our fullyear forecast of ¥123 billion. To break this down by region, first, North America increased by ¥8.3 billion, mainly due to the expansion of business and decrease in natural cat losses in Philadelphia. Also investment income increased at Delphi. Europe declined by ¥11.4 billion, mainly due to large losses and foreign exchange losses. South and Central America dropped by ¥500 million, due to foreign exchange. On the local currency basis, profit increased mainly due to increased investment income associated with rise in interest rate. Asia declined by ¥2.5 billion year-on-year because of the lack of a one-off factor which boosted the profit in the previous year in Singapore. Reinsurance profit increased by ¥1 billion year-on-year because of the lack of reserve provisioning in FY 2015 unlike the previous year, despite large losses. Life declined by ¥8.8 billion mainly due to a decrease in new business as well as in unrealized gains associated with a decline in stock market in Singapore. For more details about Philadelphia and Delphi, please refer to page 14. Next, I will go over the business unit profit of the entire group on page 15. Business unit profit is a KPI designed to properly understand corporate value by business, excluding the impact of factors that are unique to insurance business such as cat loss reserves. Different from adjusted net income, we do not include dividend from group companies as well as sales gains and losses of business-related equities. And for Life business, the growth of EV during the term under review is included in the calculation. On the J-GAAP basis, net income of TMNF grew by ¥116.2 billion year-on-year. But the business unit profit increased nearly by ¥6.3 billion year-over-year. That is because dividends from group companies and sales gains of equities are excluded from the business unit profit. Next, Domestic Life business recorded a business unit profit of negative ¥188.1 billion, and that of TMNL became negative ¥187.4 billion. Excluding the impact of economic conditions such as decline in interest rate, MCEV grew by ¥115.6 billion. And business unit profit of International Insurance business increased due to the factors that I mentioned earlier. This is the highlight of FY 2015 financial results. I will now discuss projections for FY 2016. Please turn to page 17. This is the consolidated projection for FY 2016. Net premiums written are expected to increase by ¥194.4 billion to ¥3.460 trillion, mainly due to the effect of HCC consolidation, despite the appreciation of Japanese yen. Life premiums income is expected to increase by ¥328.3 billion over the year to ¥800 billion due to the expected increase of in-force policies, decrease in surrender of variable annuities of former Financial Life, as well as HCC consolidation. Net income attributable to owners of the parent is projected to increase by ¥10.4 billion to ¥265 billion, since net losses incurred by nat cat events are expected to decrease, and provision rate for cat loss reserves is lowered at TMNF. Adjusted net income, which is an indicator of group-wide profit, is expected to increase by ¥36.1 billion year-on-year to ¥388 billion due to the factors that I just mentioned, after excluding the impact of an increasing amortization of goodwill associated with HCC consolidation. Let us next analyze how the consolidated ordinary profit is expected to change over the year on page 18. Consolidated ordinary profit is projected to decline by ¥5.8 billion yearon-year to ¥380 billion. Domestic Non-Life business is expected to decline by ¥71.5 billion to ¥315.4 billion. Underwriting profit is expected to grow due to the lower provision rate for cat loss reserves in the TMNF auto business, assuming that net losses incurred by nat cat will be a normal average level. In the meantime, net investment income and other is projected to decline due to a decrease in dividend from subsidiaries and gains on derivatives in FY 2015 are not expected to be repeated this year. Domestic Life business is expected to drop by ¥6.1 billion to ¥22.9 billion mainly due to the decrease in reversal from contingency reserves associated with maturities of policies of former Financial Life. International Insurance business is expected to increase by ¥18.3 billion year-on-year to ¥164.1 billion, mainly due to HCC consolidation and lack of large losses and foreign exchange losses which works negatively last year, despite the negative impact of stronger Japanese yen, as well as the average level of nat cat losses we are assuming this year against a relatively benign year last year. As for consolidation adjustment, negative adjustments are expected to decrease by ¥54.8 billion year-on-year because, while amortization of goodwill associated with HCC consolidation will increase the adjustment, dividend from continuing subsidiaries are expected to decrease at TMNF. Next, please turn to page 19 to review our projections on adjusted net income. Adjusted net income is expected to increase by ¥36.1 billion year-on-year to ¥388 billion. Adjusted ROE is expected to increase by 1.4 points to 10.5% partly due to an expected decrease in net asset associated with stock price decline. As for major factors behind this projection of adjusted net income over the year, International Insurance business is expected to increase their income, because HCC is now consolidated and impact of large losses last year will disappear. And in the Domestic Non-Life business, on the other hand, sales gains of securities which we recorded last year are not expected to be repeated. As for the reconciliation between J-GAAP net income and adjusted net income, please refer to page 33. Now, let me explain the definition of adjusted net income as we have added some more clarity from FY 2016. Adjusted net income is a profit indicator to understand the underlying business performance on a group-wide basis, therefore has not taken into account gains or losses on sales, revaluation of equities of subsidiaries and affiliated companies as other extraordinary profit or loss, since they are non-recurring profit or loss. Now, in case we lower our stakes in subsidiaries or affiliates, and as those companies do not qualify as subs or affiliates any longer, the treatment of their equities was not clear in the conventional definition. So, while there is no actual case as such is expected this year, we have decided to exclude gains or losses from sales revaluation of business investment equities from the adjusted net income from FY 2016. Please note that treatment of equities for pure investment purpose, to generate profit through purchases, sales as well as business unit equities, which we will sell consistently will remain unchanged, and they would continue to be included in the adjusted net income as part of the base to fund dividend payment. And please refer to page 32 and page 34 for more details including the revised definition of business unit profit. Next on page 20 for TMNF. Net premiums written are expected to increase mainly due to an increase in the number of policies from auto, despite the negative effect of revenue growth in fire in FY 2015 on an year-on-year basis. Net incurred losses in (2501) private lines are expected to drop by ¥7 billion year-on-year, mainly due to an expected decrease in nat cat losses. Provision to cat loss reserve expected to decrease by ¥55.9 billion, mainly due to the lowered provision rate for auto business. As a result, underwriting profit is projected to grow by ¥108.1 billion to ¥122 billion. Net investment income and other is projected to decline by ¥175.1 billion to ¥186.8 billion, since dividends from subs and improvement of gains and losses on derivatives which we recorded last year are not expected to be repeated. Based on these projections, after taking into account the extraordinary losses, as well as the reduction of DTAs, in conjunction with the corporate tax rate cut that we recorded last year, net income is projected to drop by ¥56.6 billion to ¥245 billion. Next, please go to page 23 for Nisshin Fire. Underwriting profit of Nisshin Fire is expected to decrease by ¥2.6 billion to ¥5.2 billion, while top line is expected to increase mainly in fire. Net losses incurred are expected to increase due to a rise in unit repair cost in the auto line, as well as decrease in the reversal of cat loss reserves. Net investment income and other is projected to be ¥1.4 billion, almost flat from a year-ago. As a result, net income is projected to decline by ¥1.8 billion year-on-year to ¥4.3 billion. Please go to page 24 for TMNL. ANP of new policies is expected to decrease by 5.8% year-on-year, since we will limit the sales of long-term saving type products. Excluding the impact of the long-term saving products, top line should grow by 6.7% year-on-year, since we will promote the shift to production products, while limiting the sales of single premium products. On the J-GAAP basis, net income and core operating profit are projected to be ¥15.6 billion and ¥24.9 billion respectively, almost flat from a year ago. Next, please go to page 25 for International Insurance. Please note that the performance of Middle East was included in Europe conventionally, but it will become part of Asia from FY 2016. And based on this new definition, actual performance of FY 2016 is restated, and Middle East is included in Asia on this slide. Net premiums written are expected to increase by 23% or ¥305.9 billion year-on-year to ¥1.610 trillion. Let us also review the projected business unit profit of International Insurance business on page 26. Business unit profit is expected to increase by ¥27.1 billion to ¥159 billion mainly due to the contribution from HCC. As for a detailed projections for Philadelphia, Delphi and HCC, please refer to page 27 later. Next, please go to page 28 to review business unit profit projections for the entire group. Business unit profit of TMNL is projected – I just would like to touch upon Domestic Life business because it's different from other business. We're looking at EV growth as a profit indicator for Life. Business unit profit of TMNL is projected to increase by ¥226.4 billion to ¥39 billion due to the negative impact of economic changes such as interest rate decline recorded in previous year, as well as to the increase in new policies. This concludes my presentation. And we will be happy to entertain your questions for the rest of the time. Thank you. Q&A",   My name is  from  IR of Tokio   Let me explain the overview of fiscal  results and fiscal  projections of Tokio   which was announced today We will mainly use the PowerPoint document that can be found on the top page of our website to give you a presentation for the first  minutes Afterwards we will have a Q&A session Please turn to page three of the presentation material First I will explain about the consolidated results overview Net premiums written was ¥ billion year-on-year plus % or increase by ¥ billion This is mainly because of increase in premium income at domestic P&C  centering around also on fire s as well as expansion of unwriting of    Next life premiums of domestic and international life  was ¥ billion year-on-year plus % or an increase by ¥ billion  premium increased because of increase in in-force policies at TMNL as well as because of less surren of variable annuities formerly sold by   Ordinary profit was year-on-year % increased by ¥ billion or ¥ billion Net income attributable to owners of the parent was year-on-year plus % or increase by ¥ billion to ¥ billion We will explain more about the consolidated ordinary profit in more details later on Adjusted net income which is KPI for the  total is calculated by taking financial ing basis net profit then deducting impact such as additional provisioning to catastrophe loss reserve Adjusted net income of the term was plus % year-on-year or increase by ¥ billion or ¥ billion Next I will explain about the factors influencing consolidated ordinary profit Please turn to page four In domestic P&C  at Tokio  &  Fire there was a dec in unwriting profit but increase in net  income ordinary profit increased by ¥ billion As for unwriting income net premiums earned increased but at the same time there was increase in net incurred losses related to natural catastrophes higher large losses and increase in net provision to catastrophe loss reserve leading to dec in unwriting profit Nisshin Fire however there was increase in the divid income and there was an improvement in the gain from the ivatives and the sales coming from the security sales which led to increase Nisshin Fire saw increase in net premiums earned but some increase in net incurred losses related to natural catastrophes and net provision for catastrophe loss reserve its ordinary profit was a dec by ¥ billion Due to the above mentioned reasons domestic P&C  overall had increased in ordinary profit by ¥ billion In estic   we saw a reversal of contingency reserve associated with surren of variable annuities Other results ordinary profit increased by ¥ billion yearon-year In overseas subsidiaries there was decrease in net incurred losses relating to natural catastrophes However there was some large losses and foreign exchange losses in addition to the appreciation of yen against emerging market currencies leading to dec in ordinary profit by ¥ billion For consolidation adjustment amount of negative adjustment increased by ¥ billion year-on-year This is because of increase in intra- divid payment from consolidated subsidiaries at Tokio  &  Fire which led to increase in consolidation elimination Let me now explain about the adjusted net income Please turn to page five Adjusted net income is based on the financial net income at the time of each financial settlement and is adjusted by excluding various reserves such as catastrophe loss reserve which is unique to P&C  as well as excluding gains or losses on sales or valuation of fixed asset It serves as  profits KPI showing profit generated by  activities of the term Adjusted net income of the term increased by ¥ billion year-on-year to ¥ billion Adjusted ROE improved by  points versus last term to %  factors of changes in adjusted net income year-on-year were improvement of gain and losses on ivatives and an increase in gains on sales of securities despite an increase in net incurred losses mainly related to natural catastrophes in

private  increased by ¥ billion and major factors are as described on the slide  expenses increased by ¥ billion due to increase in agency commissions associated with revenue growth Additional provisioning of catastrophe loss reserve increased by ¥ billion year-on-year due to the improvement of written-to-paid  loss ratio in auto  As a result unwriting profit for the term decreased by ¥ billion or ¥ billion Unwriting profit excluding the impacts of catastrophe loss reserve was a dec by ¥ billion year-on-year or ¥ billion Next I will talk about net  income and others Mainly due to the increase in divid payment from overseas subsidiaries improvement on gains and losses and ivatives and increase on gains from sales of securities net  income increased by ¥ billion to be ¥ billion The -related equities sold in fiscal  was approximately ¥ billion and gain from the sale was ¥ billion Due to the abovementioned reasons net income increased by ¥ billion to be ¥ billion Next I will explain about the combined ratio Please turn to page seven In fiscal  mainly due to the increase in natural catastrophes related claims payment private  E/I loss ratio increased by  points to % Impact of the natural catastrophes last term was  points whereas this term it was  points Loss ratio excluding natural catastrophes factor improved compared to last year As for expense ratio despite the improvement seen from the increase in net premiums written we saw increase in average agency commission rate associated with an increase in policies with higher commission rate and increase in corporate expenses due to system cost for strengthening the  platform Expense ratio went up from previous year by % to % As a result E/I combined ratio increased by  points to % On page eight we are showing the -by- premium and loss ratio situation On page nine we are showing the details of asset  results Please refer to those pages later Now I will explain about Nisshin Fire   please turn to page  Nisshin Fire saw increase in net premiums written mainly for auto At the same time there was increase in net incurred losses related to natural catastrophes and dec in amount of reversal in fire  As a result unwriting profits decreased by ¥ billion yearon-year to ¥ billion As for net  income and others mainly due to increase in impairment losses on securities net  income decreased by ¥ billion yearon-year to ¥ billion Net income of the term decd by ¥ billion year-on-year to ¥ billion mainly due to the reasons for dec in unwriting income Next I will explain about Tokio  &     Please

2333,Sasaki,20131119_TOKIO_MARINE_HD-_Earnings_Call_2013-11-20_DN000000002115755239.pdf,2013-11-19,0.0,1,0,TOKIO MARINE," 19269575  My name is Sasaki from IR of Tokio Marine Holdings, let me now explain the overview of the second quarter financial year 2013 results, as well as, the full year projections of Tokio Marine Holdings, which we have just announced today. We are providing the following four documents for this meeting. One, financial report; two, PowerPoint document entitled overview of second quarter fiscal 2013 results and full year projection; number three, supplemental material for conference call; number four, financial settlements data. I would like to ask you to access our website, then from the home page under topics, access the page where we disclose those materials and get your own copy via download. In this conference call, we will be using the PowerPoint document and the supplemental material for 2Q fiscal year 2013 conference call to give you a presentation about the overview of the second quarter results, as well as, full year projections for about 30 minutes, first. Please turn to page three of the PowerPoint document explained by the consolidated ordinary income. First I will explain about the consolidated ordinary income, ordinary income was JPY2,064.6 billion, year-on-year plus 20.3% increase by JPY347.8 billion. I will explain the reasons behind the increase by one by one. Net premiums written regained for domestic and international non-life insurance business was JPY1,415 billion, year-on-year plus 13.1% or up by JPY163.9 billion. This is mainly because of increased domestic P&C businesses, auto insurance, expansion of underwriting at International Insurance business, as well as, consolidation of Delphi and positive impact of progression of yen depreciation. Next, life premiums of domestic and international life business were JPY168.3 billion yearon-year, minus 7% or decline by JPY12.7 billion year-on-year. Tokio Marine & Nichido Life Insurance company increases in-force policies as there were favorable sales of new products in Asia and contribution from Delphi consolidation, which pushed up the income. However there was increase in surrender benefits and other refunds at financial life, which leads to decrease in life premiums overall. Next, Investment Income was JPY355.6 year-on-year plus 162.6% or up by JPY220.1 billion. This is mainly because of increase in gain on sales of marketable securities at TMNF and due to recovery of the domestic market, financial life recorded investment gains on separate accounts. Now, because the investment gain on separate account was booked, same amount transferred to the underwriting reserves was recognized which makes this factor a neutral factor to P&L. Next, I will explain the consolidated ordinary profit. Please turn to page four. Consolidated ordinary profit was JPY148.6 billion plus 79.3% or up by JPY65.7 billion. I will now explain the reasons for increase and decrease one by one for each domain on the slide. At TMNF, underwriting profits decreased, but net investment income increased which led to the ordinary income increased of JPY54.9 billion. As a result, domestic non-life business overall had increase in ordinary profit by JPY69.3 billion. I will explain the details later. In domestic life business, there was an increase in agency commissions associated with revenue growth, an increase in provisions for underwriting reserves owing to standard interest rate revisions and leading to decline in ordinary profit. On the other hand, our financial life, there was an increase in income from insurance related expenses in accordance with the recovery of the domestic stock market and decrease in reinsurance cost is due to decrease in in-force policy amount which leads to increase in ordinary profit. For domestic life overall, ordinary profit decline by JPY400 million year-on-year. In overseas subsidiaries, there was expansion of underwriting while we remain highly disappoint in underwriting contribution from Delphi consolidation and positive impacts of yen depreciation leads to year-on-year increase in ordinary profit by JPY51.8 billion. For consolidation adjustment, negative adjustment increased by JPY45.8 billion year-on-year. This is mainly due to the timing difference in receiving dividend payment from overseas subsidiaries created increase in dividend as well as by establishing the Interim holding company makes overseas subsidiaries that also receive dividend payment, which increases the amount of consolidation elimination for this quarter. Now, I will explain about the Interim net profit. Please turn to page five. Interim net profit was JPY91.4 billion year-on-year, plus 46.2% or up by JPY28.8 billion. Main reason for increase and decrease is same as what I explained earlier for ordinary profit. To add, as additional factors at TMNF there was a reaction from gains on disposal of fixed asset and extraordinary gains from reversal of price fluctuation reverse, which reflects last year. At Tokio Marine Financial Life, there was a reaction from getting extraordinary loss from increased retirement payment last year. That was the overview of financial earnings for the second quarter of the year. I will continue to explain about the condition of each company. Please turn to page six. First, I will explain about the overview of the second quarter fiscal year 2013 earnings for Tokio Marine and Nichido Fire Insurance Company. On the page, you will see up and down arrows, upward arrow means positive factor for P&L, downward arrow means negative factor for P&L. First, I will explain about the different factors for underwriting profit and loss. My explanation will be mainly about private life insurance therefore, please look at private line -- private insurance line of the chart. Net premium written in private insurance, all lines of insurance increased top lines centering around auto insurance. Net premiums written for private insurance increased 4.4% or by JPY35.4 billion. Earn premiums increased by JPY30.1 billion, pushing up the earnings. Line by line situation is explained on page eight, please look at it later. Net incurred loss of private insurance (inaudible) declined by JPY14.2 billion and I will explain each factor. As for net incurred loss from natural catastrophes although we had typhoon number 18 or Mini in September this year, there was a swing from last year when we had massive low pressure and typhoon number 4 at Guchol, net incurred loss was reduced by JPY19.3 billion. As for net incurred loss excluding natural catastrophes although we had some large accident decreased by JPY11.4 billion mainly due to decline in net incurred loss of auto and fire insurances. On the other hand last year due to provision of yen appreciation from the beginning of the year, but this year we are experiencing yen depreciation from the beginning of the year, which leads to increase in provision for foreign currency reserves for foreign currency denominated outstanding claims by JPY16.6 billion. Next I'll explain about the catastrophe loss reserve. Last fiscal year, owing to natural catastrophe such as massive low pressure we had a net reversal of reserve. This year owing to decrease in claims paid related to natural catastrophes there is a net transfer to reserve. This lead to increase in provisioning by JPY43.2 billion. As a result underwriting profit for this year was down by JPY11.6 billion to JPY8.2 billion. Next I would like to talk about investment income. Due to timing difference in quarterly recognition of dividends from overseas subsidiaries which increased dividend, and increase in gains on sales of securities owing to progress in sales of business related equity and decrease in impairment losses on securities associated with recovery in the domestic stock market rally. Net investment income increased by JPY68.8 billion to be JPY108.9 billion. The business related equity sold this quarter was approximately JPY56 billion. Most of the dividend incomes from overseas subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidated basis. As you can see decline in underwriting profit was more than offset by increase in investment income, an interim net income increased by JPY24.9 billion year-on-year to be JPY69.7 billion. Next I'll explain about the combined ratio. Please turn to page seven. First, let me explain about the written to paid basis loss ratio. Compared to last year there was decrease in paid claims relating to natural catastrophes, decrease in paid claims excluding natural catastrophes in fire and also leading to decrease in paid claims including loss adjustment expenses by JPY32.5 billion. As a result private insurance written to paid basis loss ratio improved by 6.6 points to 58.4%. Here I'd like to touch up on the earned incurred basis loss ratio. E/I loss ratio for this quarter improved by 4.2% to 62.1% this is mainly because via provisioning for claims reserves for foreign currency denominated policies increased incurred loss decreased for fire and auto insurances. Auto insurances E/I loss ratio improved by 4.8% to 64.3%, which means unit claims payments increased for vehicle damage and property damage liability insurance but reported claims decreased and unit premium increased. Now let's go back to written to paid basis combined ratio and explained about expense ratio. Due to increase in net premiums written, corporate expenses ratio improved by 0.2 point, but average agency points went up, which worsened the agency commission ratio by 0.3 point, worsening the business expense ratio by 0.1 point to 32.6%. As a result, written to paid basis combined ratio improved 6.5 points to be 90.9%. Page eight, shows line by line net premiums written and loss ratio situation, page nine shows details or the asset management results. Please look at those pages later. Now I will explain the forecast of Nichido Fire on page 10. Nichido Fire experienced positive factors for its underwriting profit such as decrease in net incurred losses, decrease in natural catastrophes, improvement in underwriting results in auto, as well as, decrease in business expenses. However, there was a decrease in reversal of the catastrophe loss reserves leading to increase in underwriting profit by JPY2.4 billion to be JPY2.5 billion. As for net investments income there was a reaction from impairment losses on securities last year. Our net investments income increased by JPY1.8 billion to JPY1.7 billion, after extraordinary gain and loss although it was impacted by the swing from several business or price fluctuation reserves last year. Net income improved by JPY2.4 billion year-on-year to be JPY2.5 billion. Next I will explain about Tokio Marine & Nichido Life insurance Company, please turn to page 11. To review the sales results of Tokio Marine & Nichido Life, let me first of all explain to you that ANP, (inaudible) historical trend of ANP which continue to grow at a fast rate in the first half of this fiscal year. ANP of new policies grew significantly by 33.7% yearon-year, thanks to continued strong sales of Medical Kit R which we launched in January 2013. In addition to the growth of the first-sector products and individual annuities. ANP's inforce policies also grew by 5.8% over the year due to the steady increase and in-force policies. Next let me go over (inaudible) Insurance premiums and others increase by JPY36.8 billion year-on-year to JPY294.2 billion, as I explained earlier for ANP this growth is also thanks to the favorable sales of new policies, as well as, steady increase in in-force policies. Net income declined by JPY2.4 billion year-on-year to JPY5 billion, this is due to the increase in provision for underwriting reserves in conjunction with the decrease in standard interest rate and increased business expenses, primarily agency commissions. I will next discuss international insurance business on page twelve. Following the standard use in our conventional disclosure and IR materials, I would like to explain the international business procurements including overseas branches of Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire equity method companies, as well as, non-consolidated companies abroad. In the second quarter, net premiums written increased by 65% or by JPY205.5 billion year-on-year to JPY521.4 billion due to organic growth of existing operations and effects of Delphi consolidation on top of weaker Japanese yen. Let me explain a few more detail by business domain, Philadelphia grew their top line by 40% based on increase in new business and rate increases on the renewal book. Delphi was consolidated to our group in the third quarter of 2012, so their contribution of JPY91.8 billion during the second quarter of this fiscal year was a net addition to our top line compared to a year ago. Kiln grew their top line by 19% primarily thanks to weaker Japanese yen. Top line contribution from South and Central America grew by 50% mainly due to the strong sales of our main -- auto policies in Brazil. Non-life operations in Asia grew their top line by 43%, mainly based on the growth of personal auto policies in major markets. Next I would discuss adjusted earnings on page 13. The adjusted earnings of international insurance business grew by 151% or JPY42.7 billion versus a year ago to JPY71 billion. This is due to the decline in natural catastrophe losses progress of our various growth measures and profit contribution of Delphi in addition to the benefit of fall in Japanese yen. If I may break this down by business domain, first, Philadelphia grew their earnings by JPY5.8 billion, in addition to the top line growth through a successful acquisition of new business and rate increase in renewal policies book. Natural catastrophe losses decreased over the year. And Delphi contribution increased our adjusted earnings by JPY17.2 billion in the first half of the fiscal year, like we saw earlier for the net payments written. Adjusted earnings from North America declined by JPY1.3 billion mainly due to Tornado in January. Kiln grew their adjusted earnings by JPY4.5 billion, in addition to the decline in natural catastrophe losses, they also posted foreign exchange gains around their US dollar denominated assets due to the weakening of UK sterling. Adjusted earnings in Europe and Middle East declined on the local currency basis due to a major accident in Europe. Adjusted earnings non-life business in Asia grew by JPY14 billion positively, this is because in addition to the top line growth in the property and automotive lines of business in Malaysia and Thailand, losses incurred related to Thai flood decreased. Adjusted earnings contributed from life business declined by JPY900 million due to a decline in EV in our Thai Life Insurance business. I will next explain to you the group wise adjusted earnings in the second quarter on page 14. The group total adjusted earnings increase by JPY34.8 billion to JPY108.2 billion mainly due to the increased contribution from overseas insurance business. However, excluding the effect of the change and risk discount rate which is used for EV calculation in life business, the adjusted earnings grew by JPY76.5 billion to JPY149.8 billion. I will explain the major reasons behind this year-on-year change. For P&C business adjusted earnings is calculated based on the statutory net income with some adjustments such as exclusion of the impact of reserves unique to non-life business such as cat loss reserves from the statutory numbers as well as sales and our realized gains and losses of assets such as equities and real estate in order to clearly indicate profit and loss generated from our business activities during the term under review. Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire grew their statutory net income by JPY24.9 billion year-onyear but the adjacent earnings grew only by JPY1.2 billion, the differential primarily comes from the adjustment made related to sales gains of scale business related equities as far as dividend income from overseas subsidiaries. For a life business year-on-year change in EV is deemed as their contribution to our adjusted earnings. EV of Tokio Marine & Nichido Life declined by JPY29.6 billion year-onyear. This is due to the change in risk discount rate associated with price and interest rate, excluding this effect their underlying adjusted earnings grew positively. Tokio Marine Nichido Financial Life grew their EV by JPY13.5 billion year-on-year, their insurance fee income increased thanks to the improvement in market environment. And as I explained earlier adjusted earnings from our international insurance business grew positively. So far I have given you the highlight of our financial result in the second quarter of FY '13. I will next discuss the full year guidance of FY '13 on page 16. Our consolidated ordinary profit forecast is now revised upwardly by JPY150 billion from our initial forecast to JPY285 billion. Let me start with our domestic P&C business. Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire made an upward revision to their investment income. This is because sales gains in securities as well as interest in dividend income from domestic equities are expected to increase supported by the improvement of market environment, in the mean time as some of the payment of claims related to Thai Flood and Hurricane Sandy is now expected to be carried over to the next fiscal year reversal from the cat loss reserves is expected to be smaller than initially expected. And since Japanese yen is expected to be weak continuously provisioning for reserve for foreign currency denominated outstanding claims is expected to increase in provisioning for reserve for outstanding claims is also expected to increase in yield of consumption tax. Based on these factors, as far as expected increase in losses incurred from major accidents. The forecasts for underwriting profit is now revised downwardly, as a result ordinary profit of TML - TMNF is revised downwardly by JPY15 billion from our initial forecast. Next on domestic life, ordinary profit forecast from TMNL is revised upwardly by JPY3.9 billion from our additional forecast. This is because investment income is expected to increase in proportion of underwriting reserve intensive product is expected to decline in product mix. That financial life, we've also made enough revisions by JPY8.4 billion from the original forecast since they expect reversal of additional provisioning for underwriting reserves based on improvement in market environment. For overseas subsidiaries we made and operate revision by JPY26.6 billion from the original forecast based on the reason group business performance and weak Japanese yen which is expected to stay. Next, please go to page 17, to discuss the forecast of our consolidated net income for FY'13. The consolidated net income is expected to be JPY185 billion on full year basis which is in upward revision by JPY15 billion mainly due to the same reasons behind the upward revisions that we made for ordinary profit. For more details by company please refer to page 19 onward. Before I conclude, I will walk you through our full-year forecast on adjusted earnings on page 18. The group total adjusted earnings is now expected to be JPY213 billion which is a downward revision by JPY13 billion. Adjusted ROE is expected to be 6.0% excluding the negative effect of the change in risk discount rate is for EV calculation by JPY44.4 billion. We expect our adjusted earnings to be JPY257 billion which is better than our initial forecast by JPY31 billion. I would discuss it in more detail by business domain, for domestic non-life business we made a revision by JPY11 billion from our original forecast. Based on the actual performance during the first half of the year, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire revises upwardly their forecast on net payments return. However, due to a fall in Japanese yen in this fiscal year, provisioning for reserve for foreign currency denominated outstanding claims expected to increase and also there will be an increased provision for outstanding claim reserve and your consumption tax hike. Meanwhile Nisshin Fire made an upward provision due to the expected profitability improvements in fire and auto business. For domestic life we made an downward revision by JPY28 billion from the original forecast, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life made a downward revision, while their top line is projected to increase based on a strong sales of the firstsector products particularly Medical Kit R, as well as, individual annuities due to decrease in disk risk discount rate we made a download revision. On the other hand at financial life we make an upward revision based on expected improvement in market environment. For International Insurance business we revised upwardly the adjusted earnings forecast given the benefit of weaker Japanese yen in profit and decrease in -- this related to Thai Flood. This concludes by presentation and I'm happy to entertain question that you may have during the rest the of the time.

in provision for foreign currency reserves for foreign currency ominated outstanding claims by JPY billion Next I'll explain about the catastrophe loss reserve Last fiscal year owing to natural catastrophe such as massive low pressure we had a net reversal of reserve This year owing to decrease in claims paid related to natural catastrophes there is a net transfer to reserve This lead to increase in provisioning by JPY billion As a result unwriting profit for this year was down by JPY billion to JPY billion Next I would like to talk about  income Due to timing difference in querly recognition of divids from overseas subsidiaries which increased divid and increase in gains on sales of securities owing to progress in sales of  related equity and decrease in impairment losses on securities associated with recovery in the domestic stock market rally Net  income increased by JPY billion to be JPY billion The  related equity sold this quer was approximately JPY billion Most of the divid incomes from overseas subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidated basis As you can see dec in unwriting profit was more than offset by increase in  income an interim net income increased by JPY billion year-on-year to be JPY billion Next I'll explain about the combined ratio Please turn to page seven First let me explain about the written to paid basis loss ratio Compared to last year there was decrease in paid claims relating to natural catastrophes decrease in paid claims excluding natural catastrophes in fire and also leading to decrease in paid claims including loss adjustment expenses by JPY billion As a result private  written to paid basis loss ratio improved by  points to % Here I'd like to touch up on the earned incurred basis loss ratio E/I loss ratio for this quer improved by % to % this is mainly because via provisioning for claims reserves for foreign currency ominated policies increased incurred loss decreased for fire and auto s Auto s E/I loss ratio improved by % to % which means  claims payments increased for vehicle damage and property damage liability  but reported claims decreased and  premium increased Now let's go back to written to paid basis combined ratio and explained about expense ratio Due to increase in net premiums written corporate expenses ratio improved by  point but average agency points went up which worsened the agency commission ratio by  point worsening the  expense ratio by  point to % As a result written to paid basis combined ratio improved  points to be % Page eight shows  by  net premiums written and loss ratio situation page nine shows details or the asset  results Please look at those pages later Now I will explain the forecast of  Fire on page   Fire experienced positive factors for its unwriting profit such as decrease in net incurred losses decrease in natural catastrophes improvement in unwriting results in auto as well as decrease in  expenses However there was a decrease in reversal of the catastrophe loss reserves leading to increase in unwriting profit by JPY billion to be JPY billion As for net s income there was a reaction from impairment losses on securities last year Our net s income increased by JPY billion to JPY billion after extraordinary gain and loss although it was impacted by the swing from several  or pe fluctuation reserves last year Net income improved by JPY billion year-on-year to be JPY billion Next I will explain about Tokio  &     please turn to page  To review the sales results of Tokio  &   let me first of all explain to you that ANP inaudible histoal trend of ANP which continue to grow at a fast rate in the first half of this fiscal year ANP of new policies grew significantly by % yearon-year thanks to continued strong sales of Medical Kit R which we launched in uary  In addition to the growth of the first-sector products and individual annuities ANP's inforce policies also grew by % over the year due to the steady increase and in-force policies Next let me go over inaudible  premiums and others increase by JPY billion year-on-year to JPY billion as I explained earr for ANP this growth is also thanks to the favorable sales of new policies as well as steady increase in in-force policies Net income decd by JPY billion year-on-year to JPY billion this is due to the increase in provision for unwriting reserves in conjunction with the decrease in standard interest rate and increased  expenses primarily agency commissions I will next discuss international   on page twelve Following the standard use in our conventional disclosure and IR materials I would like to explain the international  procurements including overseas branches of Tokio  &  Fire equity method companies as well as non-consolidated companies abroad In the second quer net premiums written increased by % or by JPY billion year-on-year to JPY billion due to organic growth of existing operations and effects of phi consolidation on top of weaker Japanese yen Let me explain a few more detail by  domain aphia grew their top  by % based on increase in new  and rate increases on the renewal book phi was consolidated to our  in the third quer of  so their contribution of JPY billion during the second quer of this fiscal year was a net addition to our top  compared to a year ago Kiln grew their top  by % primarily thanks to weaker Japanese yen Top  contribution from South and Central  grew by % mainly due to the strong sales of our main -- auto policies in Brazil Non-life operations in  grew their top  by % mainly based on the growth of personal auto policies in major markets Next I would discuss adjusted earnings on page  The adjusted earnings of international   grew by % or JPY billion versus a year ago to JPY billion This is due to the dec in natural catastrophe losses progress of our various growth measures and profit contribution of phi in addition to the benefit of fall in Japanese yen If I may break this down by  domain first aphia grew their earnings by JPY billion in addition to the top  growth through a successful acquisition of new  and rate increase in renewal policies book Natural catastrophe losses decreased over the year And phi contribution increased our adjusted earnings by JPY billion in the first half of the fiscal year like we saw earr for the net payments written Adjusted earnings from North  decd by JPY billion mainly due to nado in uary Kiln grew their adjusted earnings by JPY billion in addition to the dec in natural catastrophe losses they also posted foreign exchange gains around their US dollar ominated assets due to the weakening of UK sterling Adjusted earnings in  and Middle East decd on the local currency basis due to a major accit in  Adjusted earnings non-life  in  grew by JPY billion positively this is because in addition to the top  growth in the property and automotive s of  in Malaysia and Thailand losses incurred related to Thai flood decreased Adjusted earnings contributed from life  decd by JPY million due to a dec in EV in our Thai    I will next explain to you the  wise adjusted earnings in the second quer on page  The  total adjusted earnings increase by JPY billion to JPY billion mainly due to the increased contribution from overseas   However excluding the effect of the change and  discount rate which is used for EV calculation in life  the adjusted earnings grew by JPY billion to JPY billion I will explain the major reasons behind this year-on-year change For P&C  adjusted earnings is calculated based on the statutory net income with some adjustments such as exclusion of the impact of reserves unique to non-life  such as cat loss reserves from the statutory numbers as well as sales and our realized gains and losses of assets such as equities and real estate in or to clearly indicate profit and loss generated from our  activities during the term un review Tokio  &  Fire grew their statutory net income by JPY billion year-onyear but the adjacent earnings grew only by JPY billion the differential primarily comes from the adjustment made related to sales gains of scale  related equities as far as divid income from overseas subsidiaries For a life  year-on-year change in EV is deemed as their contribution to our adjusted earnings EV of Tokio  &   decd by JPY billion year-onyear This is due to the change in  discount rate associated with pe and interest rate excluding this effect their unlying adjusted earnings grew positively Tokio     grew their EV by JPY billion year-on-year their  fee income increased thanks to the improvement in market environment And as I explained earr adjusted earnings from our international   grew positively So far I have given you the highlight of our financial result in the second quer of FY ' I will next discuss the full year guidance of FY ' on page  Our consolidated ordinary profit forecast is now revised upwardly by JPY billion from our initial forecast to JPY billion Let me st with our domestic P&C  Tokio  &  Fire made an upward revision to their  income This is because sales gains in securities as well as interest in divid income from domestic equities are expected to increase supported by the improvement of market environment in the mean time as some of the payment of claims related to Thai Flood and Hurane Sandy is now expected to be carried over to the next fiscal year reversal from the cat loss reserves is expected to be smaller than initially expected And since Japanese yen is expected to be weak continuously provisioning for reserve for foreign currency ominated outstanding claims is expected to increase in provisioning for reserve for outstanding claims is also expected to increase in yield of consumption tax Based on these factors as far as expected increase in losses incurred from major accits The forecasts for unwriting profit is now revised downwardly as a result ordinary profit of TML - TMNF is revised downwardly by JPY billion from our initial forecast Next on domestic life ordinary profit forecast from TMNL is revised upwardly by JPY billion from our additional forecast This is because  income is expected to increase in proportion of unwriting reserve intensive product is expected to dec in product mix That financial life we've also made enough revisions by JPY billion from the original forecast since they expect reversal of additional provisioning for unwriting reserves based on improvement in market environment For overseas subsidiaries we made and operate revision by JPY billion from the original forecast based on the reason   performance and weak Japanese yen which is expected to stay Next please go to page  to discuss the forecast of our consolidated net income for FY' The consolidated net income is expected to be JPY billion on full year basis which is in upward revision by JPY billion mainly due to the same reasons behind the upward revisions that we made for ordinary profit For more details by company please refer to page  onward Before I conclude I will walk you through our full-year forecast on adjusted earnings on page  The  total adjusted earnings is now expected to be JPY billion which is a downward revision by JPY billion Adjusted ROE is expected to be % excluding the negative effect of the change in  discount rate is for EV calculation by JPY billion We expect our adjusted earnings to be JPY billion which is better than our initial forecast by JPY billion I would discuss it in more detail by  domain for domestic non-life  we made a revision by JPY billion from our original forecast Based on the actual performance during the first half of the year Tokio  &  Fire revises upwardly their forecast on net payments return However due to a fall in Japanese yen in this fiscal year provisioning for reserve for foreign currency ominated outstanding claims expected to increase and also there will be an increased provision for outstanding claim reserve and your consumption tax hike Meanwhile Nisshin Fire made an upward provision due to the expected profitability improvements in fire and auto  For domestic life we made an downward revision by JPY billion from the original forecast Tokio  &   made a downward revision while their top  is projected to increase based on a strong sales of the firstsector products picularly Medical Kit R as well as individual annuities due to decrease in disk  discount rate we made a download revision On the other hand at financial life we make an upward revision based on expected improvement in market environment For    we revised upwardly the adjusted earnings forecast given the benefit of weaker Japanese yen in profit and decrease in -- this related to Thai Flood This concludes by presentation and I'm happy to

2616,Yukinori Kuroda,20181119_Sompo_Holdings_Inc-_Earnings_Call_2018-11-23_FS000000002546780146.pdf,2018-11-19,0.0,1,0,Sompo Holdings," 19776286  I'm Kuroda with Sompo Holdings. Thank you very much for joining us despite a tight schedule to this conference call. I would like to talk about the numbers of FY 2018 first half results and full year forecast which was disclosed today and management will explain at next week's Analyst Meeting regarding the aspects of our management strategy. Please turn to page 2. In first half of FY 2018 although losses incurred from large domestic natural disasters such as Typhoon Number 21 expanded helped by rebound from the impact of hurricanes in North America in FY 2017, resulting ordinary profit was ¥27.8 billion, up by ¥24 billion and the net income was ¥22.1 billion, up by ¥21.2 billion. In light of the recent situations, we revised the full year forecast, which is indicated, with ordinary profit of ¥237 billion and the net income of ¥170 billion. As will be explained later, this is mostly reflecting the impact of domestic disasters, and also the adjustment of the landing (000121) for Sompo International. Although not shown on the slide, as was disclosed today separately, cancellation of all treasury shares was approved today which amounts to 10% of total outstanding shares that we have been acquiring for shareholder return. Please turn to page 4. This is the first half overview, positive and negative factors shown on the following pages. Page 5, underwriting profit for Sompo Japan Nipponkoa was minus ¥58.4 billion, down by ¥86 billion mainly due to the increase of ¥121 billion in incurred loss from domestic natural disasters such as Typhoon Number 21. Excluding the domestic natural disasters, profit was positive at ¥13.4 billion, due to large losses staying at around ¥1.6 billion for this first half, improving ¥13.1 billion on a year-on-year basis. The payment in progress for Typhoon Number 21 and others was about 15% at the end of September but we believe that up to 90% can be paid for the full year. And the full year performance will benefit from the gain on reversal of catastrophic loss reserve. Please turn to page 6. Investment profit was ¥65.3 billion, up by ¥35 billion. Main factors include interest and dividend income being pushed up by cancellation of funds and absence of impairment loss from consolidated subsidiaries stock from the previous year. Please turn to page 7. Ordinary profit was ¥27.8 billion, up by ¥24 billion year-on-year. And the main factors include underwriting profit, investment profit and also rebound from the impact of a hurricane in North America, which amounted to ¥74.5 billion in the previous year. Overseas subsidiaries posted negative profit. But this is a technical issue. Inclusion of amortization of intangibles from this term in the local accounting process at Sompo International. Excluding such noise, the profit was actually up. Net income is shown on page 8 for your later reference, please move on to page 9. Full year forecast numbers, as I mentioned in the outset, this number was revised from the beginning of the term, key points explained on the following pages. Please turn to page 10. Net income was down by ¥40 billion from the initial forecast. There are two main factors involved. The first factor is impact of domestic natural disasters such as Typhoon Number 21. Considering the expected losses, reversal of cat loss reserve, reinstatement of premium for reinsurance, we reduced the number by ¥19.1 billion from the beginning of the term forecast. The second factor is revision of the performance at Sompo International. The biggest difference between then and now is a degree of hardening of the market. Adjustment was made to the premium written at – in light of the current situation. And also although it doesn't impact the revised profit, there was an impact of changes in the fair value of securities. And the bottom line was adjusted by just above ¥13 billion. On page 11, you can see the breakdown of original profit at the time of the forecast, you can see the progress on page 12 and also numerical targets for the management on page 13 for your later reference. Please turn to page 15. This is the overview of Sompo Japan Nipponkoa results. Each line item will be explained in the following pages. Please turn to page 16. Net premiums written excluding CALI and household earthquake increased by 0.2%. Fire and allied lines was down due to partial transfer of products to Sompo International and personal accident was also down partly because of the transfer to other lines. Voluntary automobile was impacted by the rate reduction in January. Other lines maintained strong, compensating those products and SMEs products showed a double-digit growth. Please turn to page 17. Written and paid loss ratio. First half was 60.8%, up 2.0% year-onyear, mainly due to domestic natural disasters in fire and allied lines. Excluding the natural disaster impact, it was down by 0.9%. For full year, as claims paid for domestic natural disasters progresses, we expect an increase of 6.2% year-on-year. Please turn to page 18 for earned and incurred loss ratio. Same as written and paid loss ratio, it increased due to domestic natural disasters. It increased to 73.4%, up 12.1 points year-on-year. In the full year, we are projecting 68.5%, up 6.8% year-on-year. Main reason behind the higher loss ratio is due to the impact from domestic natural disasters. However, another reason if I may add is also because we have incorporated potential large losses quite conservatively. Please turn to page 19, net expense ratio. Net expense ratio was 33.5%, down 0.3 point year-on-year. We have been able to control both personnel and the non-personnel cost well and is trending according to the plan. There is no significant change to the full year forecast either. Please go to page 20. Combined ratio, which is the sum of loss ratio and net expense ratio I have just explained. We are showing the combined ratio excluding domestic natural disasters for your reference. Please go to page 21. Investment profit. Investment profit in the first half is, as I have explained at the beginning of this meeting. Let me supplement the explanation on the reduction of strategic holding stocks. We sold actual stocks of ¥55.2 billion by the end of the first half, thus making a good progress on the sale against the annual plan of around ¥100 billion. We are negotiating with companies where we hold shares and got the agreement for the amount exceeding the planned amount for this fiscal year. So we are going to continue to watch the market and there may be a situation where we may end up achieving more than planned. With the conservation of the current environment, we are assuming ¥147.5 billion in the full year guidance, which is advised up by ¥5.3 billion from the projection at the beginning of the year. For interest and dividend income, gains on sale of securities and impairment loss on securities, please take a look at the next page, page 23. Business forecast for Sompo Japan Nipponkoa, assumptions behind the projection are on page 24. And the usual data indicators related to automobile insurance are on page 25. Please take a look at them later. Please go to page 26. Domestic natural disasters which are the biggest noise of this fiscal year. Gross loss incurred in the first half was ¥302.8 billion and net incurred loss was ¥147.2 billion. As you can see from this page, more than half of the gross incurred loss was from the impact of Typhoon 21. In the full year forecast, assuming the loss from Typhoon 24 in and after October, loss from snow damage during the winter season and some buffer, net incurred loss is projected to be ¥175 billion from domestic natural disasters. This is higher by ¥127 billion from the initial forecast of ¥48 billion. Next page is on fund and reserve for your reference. Please turn to page 29. Overseas insurance, adjusted profit in the first half was ¥27.1 billion, up ¥62.4 billion, main reason for the increase is rebound from the impact from hurricanes in FY 2017, which was ¥57.6 billion after tax. We revised full year forecast downward to ¥54 billion from the initial ¥63 billion. Main reasons are division of SI's business projection of ¥6.8 billion and the impact from Turkish lira which was ¥1.9 billion. Page 30 shows the business result breakdown by region. Page 31 is the business result breakdown by company. Please take a look at them later on. Let me make additional explanation as SI on page 32, the largest vehicle overseas. Numbers shown are all in U.S. dollars. Top line in the first half grew mainly driven by insurance business. Incurred loss increased on the back of policy expansion, but the expenses are well controlled against the top line growth. We are receiving questions on the market hardening frequently in the meetings and interviews. But hardening is limited to low-single-digit on average in the industry. However, SI achieved high-single-digit rate increase above the market. However, we assumed more than 10% rate increase at the beginning of the year, as I mentioned in the previous meeting. So based on the current situation, we adjusted top line growth projection. That's the main outline for the division. On the next page, we are showing numerical data of SI, so please take a look later. Page 35. Himawari Life. There was a net positive impact from provisioning and the reversal of policy reserve, but all in all, the business is trending in accordance with their plan. Ordinary profit was ¥15.4 billion, up ¥6.4 billion. Net income was ¥9.4 billion, which was up ¥5.1 billion. We have not changed our full year forecast, considering some costs are second half heavy. On the next page, we are showing changing factors of net income of Himawari Life and on page 37, we are showing additional information on the adjusted profit. Please take a look at them later on. Please go to page 39. Nursing Care & Healthcare, main KPI in this business is occupancy ratio which is continuously improving. Net income in the first half was ¥2.2 billion, up ¥1.2 billion. Trend of occupancy ratio is shown on the next page, page 40. Please turn to page 42, ESR. There is no extraordinary change and there is no issue with the soundness of financials. Next page is on the breakdown of adjusted capital and risk. Please take a look at them later on. Lastly, page 44. This page is on the group-wide asset portfolio. On the next page onwards, we included asset portfolio of Sompo Japan Nipponkoa, SI and Himawari Life. I would appreciate if you could take a look at them later on but there is no noteworthy change. This completes my explanation.

Please be advised that during the presentation, all the lines other than the speakers' lines are put on mute, and this conference call is being recorded. Before we begin, let me remind you that the presentation may contain forward-looking statements based on the current projections, and they entail risks as well as uncertainties. Actual results may differ greatly from the current projections. With that, let us the start conference call. Mr. Wada, please. 01L8FQ-M Kiyoshi Wada Relations Group I am Wada from Corporate Communications and Investor Relations Group. I would like to give you overview of Tokio Marine Holdings financial results during the first quarter of FY 2017 that we announced today. I would like to give you a presentation for the first 15 minutes or so based on the PowerPoint slides that are uploaded on our homepage under Topics. And after my presentation, we would like to entertain your questions. Let me start with the overview of our consolidated results on page 2. Net premiums written were ¥919.3 billion, up by 2.8% or ¥24.9 billion year-on-year due to business expansion both home and abroad. Life insurance premiums increased by 1.9% or ¥3.9 billion from a year ago to ¥219 billion due to increase in in-force policies. Meanwhile, consolidated ordinary profit became ¥123.6 billion, down by 3.4% and net income became ¥88.1 billion, down by 9.4% year-on-year due to a decrease in sales gains of business-related equities as well as a decrease in gains and losses on derivatives at TMNF. We are working continuously to sell business-related equities for ¥100 billion or more per annum. And while in FY 2016, we sold ¥52 billion or more than half of a full year program during the first quarter, this year in FY 2017, we sold ¥42 billion in the first three months. As a result, after excluding the effect of provision for cat loss reserves and amortization of goodwill, our group-wide profit KPI-adjusted net income declined by 4.3% year-on-year to ¥119.6 billion. In terms of progress against our full year production, we have already achieved 31% of a full year production, a similar rate of progress compared to a year ago. Next, please go to page 3. In the domestic non-life business, ordinary profit of TMNF increased by ¥31.2 billion year-on-year due to a decrease in net losses incurred by natural catastrophes and an increase in dividend income from overseas subsidiaries, while provision for foreign currency-denominated outstanding claim reserves and net losses incurred by large losses increased respectively. Profit of domestic life business declined due to a decrease in sales gains of securities and an increase in provision for contingency reserves. Profit of international insurance business increased due to profit growth in North America amongst others. As for consolidation adjustment, negative adjustment increased by ¥37.7 billion year-onyear due to an increased dividend income from overseas subsidiaries at TMNF. Next, please. Go to page 4 to review adjusted net income. Adjusted net income is a group-wide KPI based on consolidated net income under JGAAP, but compensating for the impact of various reserves unique to insurance business and deducting sales gains and losses of fixed assets in order to indicate underlying profit and loss from our business operations. Adjusted net income became ¥119.6 billion, down ¥5.4 billion from a year ago. Major year-on-year changes in the reconciliation from net income under JGAAP to adjusted net income are as shown on the slide. Next, I will discuss domestic non-life business on page 5. Net premiums written for private line of business increased by 2.8% or ¥12.8 billion year-on-year, mainly due to top line growth in auto, fire and other lines of business. For more details by line of business, please refer to page 7. Net losses incurred increased by ¥4.8 billion year-on-year due to the expansion of in-force policy book as well as increase in large- mid-sized accidents, despite a decrease in net incurred losses related to natural catastrophes. Business expenses for private line of business increased by ¥3.1 billion year-on-year due to an increase in agency commissions associated with top line growth. Provision for cat loss reserves went up by ¥0.5 billion year-on-year due to the increase in net premiums written. As a result, underwriting profit of the term under review became ¥34.5 billion, down by ¥1.8 billion year-on-year. Next, net investment income and other. Details are described on page 8, but net investment income and other increased by ¥30.5 billion to ¥109.1 billion due to a growth of dividend income from subsidiaries despite decrease in gains and losses on derivatives, as well as sales gains and losses of securities. Please also note that dividends from subsidiaries do not affect consolidated numbers of our entire group as they are almost eliminated as part of the consolidation adjustment. During the term under review, we sold business-related equities by approximately ¥42 billion and the sales gains were approximately ¥30 billion. All in all, net income became ¥120.1 billion, up by ¥28 billion year-on-year. Next, let me discuss combined ratio on page 6. The loss ratio for private lines of business on an earned/incurred basis was up by 0.2 points, reaching 55.7%. Although net incurred losses relating to natural catastrophes decreased, there was an increase in provision for foreign currency-denominated outstanding claims reserves, as well as an increase in large and medium losses. The expense ratio improved by 0.2 points year-on-year, reaching 32%, mainly due to an increase in net premiums written. The private lines of business earned/incurred combined ratio as a result was flat year-on-year at 87.6%. Next, I'd like to explain the results for Nisshin Fire. Please turn to page 9. Underwriting profit for Nisshin Fire was up by ¥300 million year-on-year at ¥2 billion due to an increase in net premiums written for fire and specialty insurance, and a decrease in net incurred losses relating to natural catastrophes. Net investment income and other increased by ¥300 million to ¥300 million year-on-year due to the reversal effect of foreign exchange losses in fiscal 2016 and a decrease in impairment losses on securities. Accordingly, net income increased by ¥200 million year-on-year, reaching ¥1.3 billion. Next, I'd like to explain the results for TMNL. Please turn to page 10. New policies ANP decreased by 13.7% year-on-year due to sales suspension of long-term saving-type products and product revision in April associated with the lowering of standard interest rate, et cetera, despite continuous favorable sales of household income term insurance. In-force policy of ANP increased by 3.5% year-on-year due to an increase in new policies. Looking at key figures in financial accounting, net income decreased by ¥3.7 billion yearon-year, reaching ¥2.5 billion. However, if the decrease in gains on sales of securities and the increase in provision for contingency reserves, et cetera, is taken out, core operating profit was about the same as last fiscal year at ¥7 billion. Now, I'd like to talk about the international insurance business, which is on page 11. Net premiums written for the international insurance business increased by 2% year-on-year due to the progress of growth measures in each business segment. By region, in North America, the net premiums written increased by 4% overall due to the three companies' increasing rate in the renewal book and business expansion focusing on products such as specialty insurance. Europe increased, too, due to business expansion at Tokio Marine Kiln, et cetera. South & Central America increased, mainly due to auto insurance sales growth in Brazil. And for Asia, net premiums written increased due to the progress of growth measures in each country, mainly in India. Reinsurance decreased mainly due to a reversal effect of multiyear policies in fiscal year 2016. Life insurance increased mainly due to sales growth in Thailand, India and Indonesia. Next, I'd like to explain business unit profit for the international insurance business. Please turn to page 12. Business unit profit increased by 4% year-on-year, which was up by ¥1.7 billion due to the progress of growth measures in each business segment. On a regional basis, in North America, profit increased by ¥6.2 billion overall. Philadelphia's profit decreased, mainly due to large losses on one hand. But Delphi recorded an increase in profit due to the reversal effect of realized capital losses in fiscal 2016 and an increase in investment income. As for Europe and reinsurance, profits decreased mainly due to factor such as the deterioration of foreign exchange gains and losses. For Asia, profits increased mainly due to a reserve takedown and the reversal effect of large losses in fiscal 2016. Please refer to page 13 for the breakdown for the three North American companies. This concludes my remarks. With this, we'd like to take any questions that you may have. Thank you very much.

2612,Yukinori Kuroda,20141119_Sompo_Holdings_Inc-_Earnings_Call_2014-11-24_FS000000002417374854.pdf,2014-11-19,0.0,1,0,Sompo Holdings," 19776286  Hello, everyone. I'm Kuroda of Investor Relations of Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings. Thank you very much for joining us today in this conference call. Today I'm going to explain about the first half business performance of FY 2014, which were announced today and also the revision of annual forecast. These documents and information is up on our Web page in Excel format. Would you please check them out later? And when it comes to the business strategy, we have set up the meeting on November 27, Thursday. In that IR meeting, Mr. Sakurada, CEO, is going to explain that. Would you please look at page 2? This is the summary. In the first half of the fiscal year, now we have recognized the double of the consolidated ordinary profits of ¥103.9 billion, and we have recognized the ¥71.8 billion of extraordinary loss due to that one-time – that merger costs. And the net income was ¥15.4 billion, but we have secured the profits. There are several factors. For one thing that's the investment environment was remarkably favorable, but at the same time and the continued improvements of a profitability of domestic P&C and the life insurance. Overseas operations also have contributed. And based on this, the business performance and the market environment, we have upwardly revised that to our forecast. And including of all this, the investment of gains now we have improved that the ordinary profit by ¥20 billion to ¥172 billion, and also we have further revised the net income by ¥12 billion. These are the actual business performance numbers. Net premium income have increased by 11.2% including Sompo Japan Nipponkoa and the Maritima in Brazil and also the Canopius, and with the P&L has been consolidated since first half. When it comes to ordinary profit and net income, we already had presented that domestic P&C business have contributed a lot on the ordinary profits. Let me explain in details. Would you please, page 4. First of all, this is the breakdown of underwriting profit. And excluding (0205) – the core underwriting profits improved by ¥28.5 billion (sic) ¥28.4 billion (0210) year-on-year basis to the ¥25.6 billion as underwriting profits in the first half. Catastrophic loss reserve has mixed impact on underwriting profits and additional provision for the ph O2 Mobile insurance (0226) due to the progress of a claim as a payment was negative, and the impact ph while a (0234) reversal of the reserve had a positive impact for the snow damages. And page five, this is the breakdown of ordinary profits. Major factors for this did – begun (0245) the double of the ordinary profits. And for number one and improvements of that underwriting profits; number two, and now, we have the gains on the investments due to that favorable investment environments; and the number three, is that incremental profits from Himawari Life Insurance. The page 6 represents the net income. Just like this (0304) ¥11.6 billion Sompo Japan Nipponkoa and ¥7.9 billion for Himawari Life Insurance, and overseas facilities at ¥6.5 billion, and they all contributed to the ¥15.4 billion of net income. Now, our next page, page 7. And now, we have the heavy financial cost on the – as a onetime merger costs. And as an extraordinary loss, so let me explain about it. The one-time merger costs, we're watching in a couple of plans, amounted to the ¥71.8 billion, whether (0340) the system cost, that's primarily the cost factors. And then we have recognized it, about ¥80 billion of this – the one-time merger costs, so that the balance of ¥80 billion of the cost would be recognized after the Q3 by the end of this fiscal year. Next, page eight. This is about the revision of the forecast of business, and would you please look at the numbers we have. This is the revision based on – that's the favorable investment environment and another business environments. Let me explain in details. And this is – the breakdown of ordinary profits for the annual business forecast. The core underwriting profits, I've explained in – further from the first-and-a-half (0426) to ¥51.6 billion. On the other hand due to that improved profitability of automobile insurance, we needed to provide that additional – the catastrophic reserves. So this mean that we have the decreased and the reversal from this reserve. When it comes to the gains from the investments, we have incorporated a situation in end of September and increased by ¥26.7 billion. Forecasting for the Himawari Life Insurance and overseas operations are also revised upwardly. Consequently, and our forecast was the ¥172 billion and it was increased by ¥20 billion from the previous forecast, and ¥59.6 billion year-on-year basis. Next, would you please look at page 11. This is the trend of premiums on the performance evaluation basis, would you please check out that this trend is in upward. Now the incremental ratio is 2.1%. The 2012 indicated that net premium return, and into the first half it was plus 5.9% and domestic will be increased and then the fire insurance is high, but this is due to that now we have been favorable and in household, corporate and also an underwriting reinsurance and then also in automobile insurance, we have a favorable effect from that changing that premium ratios and then other new types of insurance, so including liability insurance, we have a large wealth contracts and have been very steady. Page 13 represents the loss ratio, and within (0601) loss ratio have risen from 60.5% to 63.3% in the first half due to the payment for the snow damage, but excluding the natural disaster and this reference ratio had been kept improving. Page 14 represents that the loss ratio on an earned and incurred basis has been flat in the first half with 63%, and annually, we expected improvements from the 68.1% from the first half to the 64.5%. And for the second half of FY 2014, we have been conservative in estimating about an expansion of business of undertaking reinsurance business in overseas market or the incremental outstanding loss reserve due to the depreciation of the yen, and then also our estimates are that the loss on the large wealth (0652) contracts of the new types of insurance. Taken all this included that we have been rather conservative. Page 15 represents the net expense ratio. Expense ratios have steadily declined was that the primary factor of the labor cost decline and now in the first half, we have improved it by 0.5%, it's 33.9% and annually, we plan to decline up to 33.2%. Page 16 shows that the combined ratio. This is combining that written loss ratio and expense ratios, and would please check out the figures and annually, it will be 97%. Page 17 indicated that combined ratio for the automobile insurance and this is due to the revision of a payment rates or the revision on the driver rating and those have a revision have contributed to the improvements steadily. And combined ratio in the first half is 94.6%, this is a 1.6 point improvement, but on annually, now we have the forecast annually for the 94.5% quite flat from the first half, and we expected 1.8 point (0800) of improvement. On page 18, you can find out the trend of the number of reported claims historically. The number of reported claims has been steady and – but we assume part of that reason for this might include reduced number of low valued (0818) claims due to the revision of the driver rate, and in Q2 it was minus 5.9%.",   Hello everyone I'm  of   of  Japan Nipkoa  Thank you very much for joining us today in this conference call Today I'm going to explain about the first half  performance of FY  which were announced today and also the revision of annual forecast These documents and information is up on our Web page in Excel format Would you please check them out later?

I will explain the fiscal year 2017 second quarter results and full-year projections of Tokio Marine Holdings, which was announced today. I would like to ask you to access our website. Then from the homepage under Topics, access the page to find the PowerPoint materials which we will be using today in the conference call. Presentation will be about 25 minutes, and after that we will take questions. Please turn to page 3 for the consolidated results overview. Net premiums written was ¥1,806.4 billion year-on-year plus 6.2%, increased by ¥105.6 billion due to the expansion of underwriting at domestic non-life and international subsidiary, as well as the yen depreciation. Life insurance premiums increased due to increase in in-force policies at TMNL, where life premiums was ¥445.9 billion year-on-year plus 4.9% or increased by ¥21.4 billion year-on-year. As for profit, due to large natural catastrophes such as North American hurricanes and large losses at TMNF, consolidated ordinary profit was ¥93.6 billion and net income was ¥78.5 billion. Adjusted net income, a group KPI for profit which adjust impact of a catastrophe loss reserve and amortization of goodwill declined by ¥75.7 billion to ¥143.5 billion. Before moving on to the next page, I will explain about the impact of large natural catastrophes such as North American hurricanes to the entire group. Please turn to page 33. As you can see, the net loss incurred for the large natural catastrophes is almost the same amount as what we announced in October. The large natural catastrophes we are referring to this time occurred in August to September. Therefore, usually any impact from the overseas businesses do not appear in the second quarter earnings. However, this time, due to its materiality, we are adjusting the consolidation accounting and including its impact to the second quarter earnings of the group this time under the title of adjustment relating to large natural catastrophes. We are showing the full-year projections of natural catastrophes on the bottom of page 33, and we are expecting increase in the amount for both domestic and international businesses. Next, I will explain about the consolidated ordinary profit. Please turn to page 4. In the domestic P&C business, although there was an increase of net investment income due to increase in dividend income from overseas subsidiaries at TMNF. Underwriting profit decreased due to impacts of large losses which led to ordinary profit decrease by ¥14 billion. In domestic life business, ordinary profit decreased due to increase in provision for contingency reserve and decrease in gains on sales of securities. In overseas subsidiaries, the progression of yen depreciation and profit expansion in North America led to profit increase. However, including the impacts of large natural catastrophes, ordinary profit decreased. For consolidation adjustments, amount of negative adjustment expanded by ¥39.2 billion year-on-year due to increase in dividend payment from consolidated subsidiaries at TMNF. Now, let me explain about adjusted net income. Please turn to page 5. Adjusted net income decreased by ¥75.7 billion to ¥143.5 billion. Along the reconciliation process from statutory accounting to net income to adjusted net income, you can see the various movements year-on-year as shown on the slide. Now, I will turn to domestic P&C business. Please turn to page 6. Our net premiums written also in other lines of insurance grew their top line, which led to 1.9% year-on-year or up by ¥17.4 billion. Please refer to page 8 for line-by-line situation. Net incurred losses increased by ¥62.6 billion due to increase in net incurred losses relating to natural catastrophes and reversal effect of decrease in provision for foreign currency denominated outstanding claims reserves due to appreciation of yen last year, as well as impacts of large looses. In the net incurred losses relating to natural catastrophes, the impact of Reinsurance from oversea subsidiaries relating to large natural catastrophes are included. Business expenses for private lines of insurance increased by ¥4 billion due to increase in agency commissions associated with the revenue growth and others. As a result, underwriting profit for the quarter decreased by ¥53.9 billion year-on-year to ¥7.9 billion. As for net investment income and others, net investment income increased by ¥36.6 billion to be ¥132.8 billion due to increase in dividend income from overseas subsidiaries despite decrease in gains and losses and derivatives and sales of securities. Details explained on page 9. Most of the dividend income from subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidated basis. Therefore, there is no impact by this to group's consolidated earnings. Business-related equities sold in the first half of the year was ¥68 billion and capital gain from the sales was ¥52 billion. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, net income decreased by ¥11.6 billion to be ¥112.4 billion. Next, I will explain about the combined ratio. Please turn to page 7. The private insurance line's E/I loss ratio increased to 61.8%, increased by 5.8 points due to increase in natural catastrophes related incurred losses, as well as reversal effect from last year's decrease in provision for foreign currency denominated outstanding claims reserves and the impact of large losses. As for the expense ratio, it worsened by 0.2 points year-on-year to 32.2%, mainly due to increase in net premiums written. As a result, private insurance line's E/I combined ratio went up by 5.6 points to be 94%. Now, I will explain about Nisshin Fire insurance company. Please turn to page 10. Nisshin Fire's underwriting profit increased mainly due to net premiums written increased in fire and new products as well as decrease in net incurred losses relating to natural catastrophes, which resulted in underwriting profit increase by ¥0.6 billion year-on-year to ¥3.2 billion. As for net investment income and other, there was increase by ¥0.3 billion year-on-year to ¥0.9 billion due to reversal effect of foreign exchange losses in fiscal 2016. As for net income, there was a decline by ¥0.5 billion year-on-year to be €2.6 billion. Next, I will explain about Tokio Marine & Nichido Life Insurance Company. Please turn to page 11. As for new policy ANP, while we suspended the sales of long-term saving product, new policy ANP declined by 11% year-on-year. However, excluding the long-term saving-type products, new policies ANP increased by 2.6% as we saw favorable sales of household income term insurance. For in-force policies ANP, we saw 3.7% growth year-onyear due to increase in new policies. As for key figures in financial accounting, net income decreased by ¥4.4 billion year-onyear to ¥6.1 billion due to increase in provision for contingency reserves and decreasing gains on sales of securities. As for core operating profit, it decreased by ¥2.3 billion yearon-year to ¥14.2 billion due to partial provision of underwriting reserves owing to the last minute demand before reduction of the standard interest rate. Now, I will explain about international insurance business. Please turn to page 12. Net premiums written of international insurance business increased by 14% over year to ¥867.6 billion due to the steady progress of growth measures implemented in each business and depreciation of Japanese yen. As you can see on the table on the far right, after excluding the currency impact, the top line still grew by 5%. If we break this down by region, North America grew by 13% due to rate increases in renewal book and business expansion at three major group companies within the region. Europe also grew, thanks to recent expansion at Tokio Marine Kiln. In South and Central America, auto business grew in Brazil. And growth measures taken in various markets in Asia, particularly in India went well. As a result, those regions recorded significant growth respectively. Next, to review business unit profit of international insurance business, please refer to page 13. Business unit profit declined by 55% or ¥43.6 billion year-on-year after reflecting adjustment related to large nat cat losses such as North American hurricanes during the third quarter. However, excluding this adjustment, the profit increased by ¥5.2 billion yearon-year. As we reviewed at the outset, business unit profit by region does not reflect the impact of large nat cat events. On that note, I will now explain actual performance by region. First, North America grew by ¥10.8 billion overall, while Philadelphia was hit by large losses and TMHCC suffered from deterioration of foreign exchange gains and losses. Delphi's profit increased due to the absence of realized capital losses recorded in fiscal year 2016 and growth in investment income. Europe and Reinsurance declined due to deterioration of foreign exchange gains and losses. However, Asia grew positively due to reserve takedown and profitability improvement in each country. For more details about three major group companies in North America, please refer to page 14 later. Next, I will explain business unit profit of our entire group. Please go to page 15. We use business unit profit as a KPI to measure enterprise value of each business. Different from adjusted net income, dividend from group companies and gains and losses from sales of business-related equities are not included, and business unit profit for life insurance business is defined as the change (001533) over a term under review. Business unit profit of domestic non-life business was ¥69.1 billion, down by ¥29.6 billion year-on-year due to the reasons explained on the slide. Next, domestic life business went down by ¥113.6 billion to ¥86 billion. This is mainly because of the absence of the impact of the changes in the measurement methodologies of MCEV that we made last year, while there were positive factors such as rise in yen rate and economic improvement. International insurance business declined by ¥43.6 billion to ¥36 billion as we reviewed earlier. This concludes the highlight of the second quarter results. I will now discuss full-year projections of FY 2017. Please turn to page 17. As for net premiums written in fiscal year 2017, we revised upwardly the original projection by ¥50 billion to ¥3,540 billion due to business expansion and depreciation of Japanese yen at overseas group companies. We also made an upward revision to life insurance premiums by ¥20 billion to ¥910 billion due to growth of in-force policies at TMNL. Meanwhile, as for profit, we revised downwardly both consolidated ordinary profit and net income attributable to owners of the parent, due to large nat cat events in TMNF and international group companies, as well as increased provision for underwriting reserves for a new product at TMNL. As a result, adjusted net income was also revised downwardly by ¥67 billion from the original projection to ¥315 billion. Please proceed to page 18. Ordinary profit of TMNF is revised downwardly by ¥17 billion to ¥322 billion, and Nisshin Fire is revised upwardly by ¥0.3 billion to ¥6.8 billion. Therefore, ordinary profit of the entire domestic non-life business is revised downwardly by ¥16.7 billion from the original projection to ¥328.8 billion. Projection for domestic life insurance business is ¥25.1 billion revised downwardly by ¥9.3 billion. And international insurance business is ¥125 billion, down by ¥45 billion from the original projection. As for consolidation adjustment, negative adjustment is expected to be reduced by ¥6 billion from the initial expectation. Next, to review guidance on adjusted net profit, please refer to page 19. Major changes made from the original projections in the reconciliation from JGAAP-based net income to adjusted net income are shown on the slide. Adjusted net income is revised downwardly by ¥67 billion from the original projection to ¥315 billion. Next I will discuss domestic non-life business, so please go to page 20. At TMNF, underwriting profit is expected to go down by ¥23 billion from the original projection to ¥107 billion, mainly due to increase in net losses incurred related to natural catastrophes and impact of large losses. Net investment income and other is revised upwardly by ¥5.9 billion to ¥214.1 billion due to increase in sales gains and losses of securities despite decreased dividend from subsidiaries. As a result, net income is expected to be ¥250 billion, down by ¥20 billion from the original projection. Next, for Nisshin Fire, please turn to page 23. Net income of Nisshin Fire is expected to reach ¥4.9 billion, up by ¥0.4 billion from the original projection, reflecting the upward revisions made to the projected underwriting profit and net investment income and other. Next, please go to page 24 for TMNL. ANP of new business is expected to be ¥114.3 billion, which is an upward revision by ¥22.7 billion from the original projection, reflecting the impact of a new commercial product. ANP of policies in-force are as shown on the slide. As for key figures on the financial accounting basis, net income is projected to be ¥16.3 billion, down by ¥7.6 billion; and core operating profit at ¥28 billion, down by ¥6.4 billion from the original projections, respectively. This is due to an increase in provision for underwriting reserves associated with the upward revision made to the new policy ANP. Next, for international insurance business, please turn to page 25. Net premiums written of international insurance business is revised upwardly by ¥69 billion to ¥1,711 billion. This is due to business expansion, mainly in North America, South and Central America, and Reinsurance business, as well as increased shareholdings in a P&C subsidiary in India. Next, to review the guidance of business unit profit of international insurance business, please go to page 26. Business unit profit is revised downwardly by ¥49 billion from the initial expectation, mainly due to the impact of large nat cat events such as hurricanes in North America. As for projection of three major group companies in North America and business unit profit on a group-wide basis, please prefer to page 27 and 28, respectively. Last, but not least, I would touch upon our ESR on page 30. Our ESR is calculated based on risks measured at 99.95% VaR to maintain AA credit rating, while referring to European Solvency II method and deducting restricted capital from capital calculation. To review where our ESR stands at the moment, please go the next page. This shows major factors behind the movement of ESR from the end of March 2017 through the end of September 2017. While net asset value decreased due to shareholder returns, risk capital also decreased. As a result, our ESR became 141%. Net asset value declined to ¥3.4 trillion mainly due to share repurchase, while there were positive factors such as profit contributions during the first half of the year, an increase in unrealized gains in business-related equities. Risk capital declined to ¥2.4 billion, mainly due to decrease in interest rate risks associated with a decrease in interest rate volatility in addition to sales of business-related equities. Now this time, we decided for ¥100 billion share repurchase program based on our comprehensive assessment of factors such as liquidity of our shares in the market in addition to the level of ESR. This concludes my explanation. We would now like to open the floor for Q&A session. Thank you for your kind attention. Q&A",   My name is  from the IR  of Tokio   I will explain the fiscal year  second quer results and full-year projections of Tokio   which was announced today I would like to ask you to access our website Then from the homepage un Topics access the page to find the PowerPoint materials which we will be using today in the conference call Presentation will be about  minutes and after that we will take questions Please turn to page  for the consolidated results overview Net premiums written was ¥ billion year-on-year plus % increased by ¥ billion due to the expansion of unwriting at domestic non-life and international subsidiary as well as the yen depreciation   premiums increased due to increase in in-force policies at TMNL where life premiums was ¥ billion year-on-year plus % or increased by ¥ billion year-on-year As for profit due to large natural catastrophes such as North n huranes and large losses at TMNF consolidated ordinary profit was ¥ billion and net income was ¥ billion Adjusted net income a  KPI for profit which adjust impact of a catastrophe loss reserve and amortization of goodwill decd by ¥ billion to ¥ billion Before moving on to the next page I will explain about the impact of large natural catastrophes such as North n huranes to the entire  Please turn to page  As you can see the net loss incurred for the large natural catastrophes is almost the same amount as what we announced in October The large natural catastrophes we are referring to this time occurred in  to September Therefore usually any impact from the overseas es do not appear in the second quer earnings However this time due to its materiality we are adjusting the consolidation ing and including its impact to the second quer earnings of the  this time un the title of adjustment relating to large natural catastrophes We are showing the full-year projections of natural catastrophes on the  of page  and we are expecting increase in the amount for both domestic and international es Next I will explain about the consolidated ordinary profit Please turn to page  In the domestic P&C  although there was an increase of net  income due to increase in divid income from overseas subsidiaries at TMNF Unwriting profit decreased due to impacts of large losses which led to ordinary profit decrease by ¥ billion In domestic life  ordinary profit decreased due to increase in provision for contingency reserve and decrease in gains on sales of securities In overseas subsidiaries the progression of yen depreciation and profit expansion in North  led to profit increase However including the impacts of large natural catastrophes ordinary profit decreased For consolidation adjustments amount of negative adjustment expanded by ¥ billion year-on-year due to increase in divid payment from consolidated subsidiaries at TMNF Now let me explain about adjusted net income Please turn to page  Adjusted net income decreased by ¥ billion to ¥ billion Along the reconciliation process from statutory ing to net income to adjusted net income you can see the various movements year-on-year as shown on the slide Now I will turn to domestic P&C  Please turn to page  Our net premiums written also in other s of  grew their top  which led to % year-on-year or up by ¥ billion Please refer to page  for -by- situation Net incurred losses increased by ¥ billion due to increase

well as impacts of large looses In the net incurred losses relating to natural catastrophes the impact of Re from oversea subsidiaries relating to large natural catastrophes are included  expenses for private s of  increased by ¥ billion due to increase in agency commissions associated with the revenue growth and others As a result unwriting profit for the quer decreased by ¥ billion year-on-year to ¥ billion As for net  income and others net  income increased by ¥ billion to be ¥ billion due to increase in divid income from overseas subsidiaries despite decrease in gains and losses and ivatives and sales of securities Details explained on page  Most of the divid income from subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidated basis Therefore there is no impact by this to 's consolidated earnings -related equities sold in the first half of the year was ¥ billion and capital gain from the sales was ¥ billion Due to the above-mentioned reasons net income decreased by ¥ billion to be ¥ billion Next I will explain about the combined ratio Please turn to page  The private  's E/I loss ratio increased to % increased by  points due to increase in natural catastrophes related incurred losses as well as reversal effect from last year's decrease in provision for foreign currency ominated outstanding claims reserves and the impact of large losses As for the expense ratio it worsened by  points year-on-year to % mainly due to increase in net premiums written As a result private  's E/I combined ratio went up by  points to be % Now I will explain about Nisshin Fire  company Please turn to page  Nisshin Fire's unwriting profit increased mainly due to net premiums written increased in fire and new products as well as decrease in net incurred losses relating to natural

favorable sales of household income term  For in-force policies ANP we saw % growth year-onyear due to increase in new policies As for key figures in financial ing net income decreased by ¥ billion year-onyear to ¥ billion due to increase in provision for contingency reserves and decreasing gains on sales of securities As for core operating profit it decreased by ¥ billion yearon-year to ¥ billion due to pial provision of unwriting reserves owing to the last minute demand before reduction of the standard interest rate Now I will explain about international   Please turn to page  Net premiums written of international   increased by % over year to ¥ billion due to the steady progress of growth measures implemented in each  and depreciation of Japanese yen As you can see on the table on the far right after excluding the currency impact the top  still grew by % If we break this down by region North  grew by % due to rate increases in renewal book and  expansion at three major  companies within the region  also grew thanks to recent expansion at Tokio  Kiln In South and Central  auto  grew in Brazil And growth measures taken in various markets in  picularly in India went well As a result those regions recorded significant growth respectively Next to review   profit of international   please refer to page    profit decd by % or ¥ billion year-on-year after reflecting adjustment related to large nat cat losses such as North n huranes during the third quer However excluding this adjustment the profit increased by ¥ billion yearon-year As we reviewed at the outset   profit by region does not reflect the impact of large nat cat events On that note I will now explain actual performance by region First North  grew by ¥ billion overall while aphia was hit by large losses and TMHCC suffered from deterioration of foreign exchange gains and losses phi's profit increased due to the absence of realized capital losses recorded in fiscal year  and growth in  income  and Re decd due to deterioration of foreign exchange gains and losses However  grew positively due to reserve takedown and profitability improvement in each country For more details about three major

 was ¥ billion down by ¥ billion year-on-year due to the reasons explained on the slide Next domestic life  went down by ¥ billion to ¥ billion This is mainly because of the absence of the impact of the changes in the measurement methodologies of MCEV that we made last year while there were positive factors such as rise in yen rate and economic improvement    decd by ¥ billion to ¥ billion as we reviewed earr This concludes the highlight of the second quer results I will now discuss full-year projections of FY  Please turn to page  As for net premiums written in fiscal year  we revised upwardly the original projection by ¥ billion to ¥ billion due to  expansion and depreciation of Japanese yen at overseas  companies We also made an upward revision to life  premiums by ¥ billion to ¥ billion due to growth of in-force policies at TMNL Meanwhile as for profit we revised downwardly both consolidated ordinary profit and net income attributable to owners of the parent due to large nat cat events in TMNF and international  companies as well as increased provision for unwriting reserves for a new product at TMNL As a result adjusted net income was also revised downwardly by ¥ billion from the original projection to ¥ billion Please proceed to page  Ordinary profit of TMNF is revised downwardly by ¥ billion to ¥ billion and Nisshin Fire is revised upwardly by ¥ billion to ¥ billion Therefore ordinary profit of the entire domestic non-life  is revised downwardly by ¥ billion from the original projection to ¥ billion Projection for domestic life   is ¥ billion revised downwardly by ¥ billion And international   is ¥ billion down by ¥ billion from the original projection As for consolidation adjustment negative adjustment is expected to be reduced by ¥ billion from the initial

are shown on the slide Adjusted net income is revised downwardly by ¥ billion from the original projection to ¥ billion Next I will discuss domestic non-life  so please go to page  At TMNF unwriting profit is expected to go down by ¥ billion from the original projection to ¥ billion mainly due to increase in net losses incurred related to natural catastrophes and impact of large losses Net  income and other is revised upwardly by ¥ billion to ¥ billion due to increase in sales gains and losses of securities despite decreased divid from subsidiaries As a result net income is expected to be ¥ billion down by ¥ billion from the original projection Next for Nisshin Fire please turn to page  Net income of Nisshin Fire is expected to reach ¥ billion up by ¥ billion from the original

2611,Yukinori Kuroda,20141118_Sompo_Holdings_Inc-_Earnings_Call_2014-11-20_DN000000002182540777.pdf,2014-11-18,0.0,1,0,Sompo Holdings," 19776286  Hello, everyone. I'm a Kuroda of Investor Relations of Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings. Thank you very much for joining us today in this conference call. Today I'm going to explain about that first our business performance of FY 2014, which we have announced today and also the revision of annual forecast. This document and information is up in our page in excel format, would you please check them out later. And when it comes to the business strategy where we have set up the meeting on November 27th of Thursday is our meeting and Mr. Sakurada, CEO is going to explain that. Would you please look at page two. This is a summary and then first half of this fiscal year, now we have recognized the double of the consolidated profits of JPY103.9 billion and we have recognized JPY71.8 billion of extraordinary loss due to that one-time -- that major cost and the net income was JPY15.4 billion, but we have secured the profits. There are several factors. One thing that's the investment environment was remarkably favorable, but at the same time and the continued improvements of the profitability of domestic P&C and the life insurance overseas operations also have contributed. And then based on this, the business performance and the market environment, we have upwardly revisions, revised the forecast and including of all this the investment gains, now, we have improved ordinary profit by JPY20 billion to JPY172 billion and also you we have upward revised in net income by JPY12 billion. This is the actual business performance numbers. Net premium income, they have increased by 11.2%, including the Sompo Japan Nipponkoa and Maritima in Brazil and also that Canopius and with the P&L has been consolidated since first half. When it comes to ordinary profit and the net income, we already have presented that our domestic P&C business have contributed a lot on the ordinary profits. Let me explain in details. Would you please, page four. First of all, this is the breakdown of underwriting profit and excluding the (inaudible) core underwriting of profits improved by the JPY28.5 billion yearon-year basis to JPY25.6 billion as underwriting profits in first and a half. Catastrophic loss reserve has mixed impact on underwriting profits, an additional provision for the automobile insurance is due to the progress of the claim as a payment was negative and impact of reversal of the reserve had a positive impact for that to snow damages. On page five, this is the breakdown of ordinary profits. Major factors for this have been the double of the ordinary profits and for number one, an improvement of that underwriting profits. Number two, now we have the gains on the investment due to that favorable investment environment. And the number three is that incremental profits from Himawari Life Insurance. Then page six represents the net income. Just like this, 11.6 billion, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa and 7.9 billion for Himawari Life Insurance and overseas subsidiaries JPY6.5 billion and they're all contributed to the JPY15.4 billion of the income. Now on page, page seven and now we have the heavy financial cost on that as a onetime merger cost and as an extraordinarily loss, so let me explain about it. That one-time merger cost we are watching in a couple of plan amounted to JPY71.8 billion where that system costs, that's the primary the cost factors. And we have recognized about JPY80 billion of this, the one-time merger cost, so that the balance of JPY80 billion of the cost would be recognized after the Q3 by the end of this fiscal year. Next page eight, this is about the revision of the forecast of business and would you please look at the numbers ahead. And this is the revision based on the favorable investment environment and another business environment. Let explain in details. And this is the breakdown of ordinary profit for the annual business forecast. The core underwriting profits have expanded further from the first half to JPY51.6 billion. On the other hand, due to the improved profitability of automobile insurance, we need to provide that additional -- this catastrophic reserves. So this means that we have a decrease in the reversal from this reserve. When it comes to the gains from the investments, we have incorporated the situation in the end of September and increased by JPY26.7 billion. Forecast for the Himawari Life Insurance and obviously, the operations also revised upwardly. Consequently, and our forecast was the JPY172 billion and it was increased by JPY20 billion from the previous forecast and JPY59.60 billion year-over-year basis. Next, would you please go to page 11. This is the trend of premiums on the performance evaluation basis. Would you please check out that the trend is upward. Now, the incremental ratio is 2.1%, with 12 indicated that net premium written and end of the first half, it was plus 5.9%. And the rest of the increase in the fire insurance is high, but this is due to that -- now that we have been favorable and in household to corporate and also underwriting the reinsurance and also in the automobile insurance we have favorable effect from that changing that ratio and then other new types of insurance, including liability insurance. We have a large contracts and it had been very steady. Page 13 represents the loss ratio and written loss ratio have risen from 60.5% to 63.3% in the first half due to the payment for the snow damage, but excluding the natural disaster and this reference ratio had been kept improving. Page 14 represents that loss ratio on an earned and incurred basis has been flat in the first half with 63% annually. Now, we expected improvements from the 68.1% from the half to the 64.5%. As for the second half of FY 2014, we've been conservative in estimating about our expansion of business of undertaking reinsurance business in overseas market or the incremental outstanding will also result, but due to the depreciation of the Yen. And then also our estimates are that the loss on those large worth contracts of the new types of insurance. Taking all these included that we have been whether conservative. Page 15 that represents the net expense ratio. Expense ratios have steadily declined where the primary factor of the labor cost declined and now and in the first half, we have improved by 0.5% to 33.9%, and annually, we planned to decline up to 33.2%. Page 16, this shows the combined ratio. This is the combining that the written loss ratio and expense ratios and would you please check out to the figures and annually, it will be 97%. Page 17 indicated the combined ratio for the automobile insurance and this is due to the revision of the premium rates or the revision on the driver rating and those have a revision, have contributed to the improvements steadily and combined ratio in the first half is 94.6%, this is 1.6 point improvement, but annually, now we have the forecast with annually for the 94.5% flat from the first half and we expected 1.8 points as improvements. On page 18, we can find out the trend of the number of reported claims historically. The number of reported claims has been steady and we assumed the part of that reason for this might include reducing number of low value declines due to the revision of the driver race and in Q2, it was minus 5.9%. Next please look at page 19 for the investment profit. The investment profit is trending relatively high reflecting the high stock prices and also the weak Yen. The total investment profit recorded for the first half was JPY72.4 billion. As for the gain on securities sales, we've reduced the exposure of JPY42.9 billion for strategic holding stocks. Among this, the actual stock sales was JPY30.5 billion and we are proceeding with this very steadily. As for the forecast of the full year, we have added net interest and dividend income as well as gain on securities sales. And now we are forecasting JPY132.2 billion as a result. Please turn to page 20, this is regarding the forecast for the P&C business. Please confirm the details later. This time, we're looking at the insurance underwriting profit, it is minus JPY5.5 billion compared to the previous forecast. We are very steady here, but when it comes to the loss reserves and also reversal of the provisions, which has gone down, we believe that we should be conservative for the second half. This is reflected into the numbers here. Therefore, in terms of the investment profit, this is the part where we have revised upwards. We have calculated the numbers according to this thinking. At this point, if there is any uncertainties, it will be the reduction of the corporate tax. If this happens, that impact has not been reflected into these numbers. Now please turn to page 22, I would like to add some information regarding natural disasters. For the first half, we had impact from typhoon number 11 and torrential rain from Hiroshima Prefecture, but the incurred losses totaled JPY13.4 billion. Even if we take into account the typhoon number 18 and number 19 which occurred in October, we do not expect to achieve 43 billion. Our initial forecast for this fiscal year. So our revised forecast is now JPY35 billion. Please turn to page 23, this is the snow damage from February. In the first half, we have a positive effect of JPY28.4 billion due to the reversal of outstanding reserves. And the remaining outstanding loss reserve is JPY11.7 billion as of September end, mainly related to corporate properties, but we plan to complete payments by the end of this fiscal year. Now, I would like to talk about the life insurance business, which starts from page 25. So, for both premium in-force and MCEV, these are both trending well, please confirm those points. Moving on to page 26, we have the premiums and various other figures. And because we're doing well with the sales of medical insurance products, the annualized new premium is going to go up dramatically. For FY'14, we expect the annualized net premium to reach JPY43.6 billion, up 43.4% year-on-year. As for the ordinary profit and net income, we looked at the first half results and decided to upward revise our numbers. The amount of business in force continues to increase mainly due to the protection type products. Next, please turn to page 27, this is regarding the payment method at Himawari Life. As for the payment method, this excludes the lump-sum payment, so basically it is the installment payment, which is growing in the base. Page 28, this is the sales from the P&C insurance channel, it's growing steadily and the protection type products now comprise about 70% of the total products and this level has been maintained. Please turn to Page 29, this is regarding the J-GAAP profits. As for the first half, basic profit and net income both trended very well. In the first half, basic profit was JPY13.9 billion, which is JPY6.5 billion up and the net income was JPY7.9 billion, which is JPY4.6 billion up. The business side is also good, but also related to the medical insurance related new products, there is some movements in the switchover to new products. And so therefore, we have some technical issues that helped push the profit up. Technically, the reversal of insurance provision due to surrenders from existing products is the cause. Looking at the first half numbers for the full-year estimate, we have a basic profit of JPY20.4 billion, which is JPY4.4 billion up and net income JPY11 billion, which is JPY3 billion up. Please turn to page 30, this is MCEV for your reference. As for the full year growth and adjusted EV, this is JPY80 billion, which is still a very high level of continued growth. Initially, we actually showed you the guideline of JPY84 billion, but this reflects the switchover to new medical insurance products, as I mentioned earlier. As for the EV as of the end of this fiscal year, it is expected to reach JPY830.3 billion. From page 31 and on, we talk about our overseas business. The overseas business is good in the first half. The net premiums written was JPY129.3 billion with the impact of Canopius included into our consolidated P&L numbers and also the Brazil Maritima impact, we have a very good increase in the income. For the full-year, we expect an incremental growth, close to JPY130 billion to achieve JPY285 billion. As for the net income, it has increased to JPY6.3 billion from JPY4.9 billion last year due to good business in Canopius and also Turkey, Singapore and also for the full-year performance, we have revised the net income to JPY14.2 billion, up JPY1.2 billion from the beginning of this fiscal year. Please turn to Page 33, this is by geography. The top line grew in Europe and South America and for the net income, Europe and Asia has made a good contribution. So, please confirm these points. Page 34, we have some numbers by company, companies in our Group. Please turn to 36, this is showing the asset management portfolio as of September end. Please look at page 36 for non-life and page 37 for life businesses. For both life and non-life, there has been no change in our management policy. The asset portfolio as of September end had some changes due to higher stock prices and the weak yen, but when you look at it in comparison to the end of March, there has been no big changes. As for the duration, it tends to be slightly long for liability for both non-life and life. We will continue to manage our investments with a focus on profitability and also stability and liquidity. At the very end, I'd like to talk to Page 39. This adjusted performance has been shown here reflected in our business management numerical targets. When you look at the number, second line from the bottom, you can see that we had accounted for 1.460 in the beginning, but now it's up to 1.569. And also the ROE is up from 5.9% to 6.2%. This concludes my presentation. Questions And Answers",   Hello everyone I'm a  of   of  Japan Nipkoa  Thank you very much for joining us today in this conference call Today I'm going to explain about that first our  performance of FY  which we have announced today and also the revision of annual forecast This document and information is up in our page in excel format would you please check them out later And when it comes to the   where we have set up the meeting on November th of Thursday is our meeting and Mr   is going to explain that Would you please look at page two This is a summary and then first half of this fiscal year now we have recognized the double of the consolidated profits of JPY billion and we have recognized JPY billion of extraordinary loss due to that one-time -- that major cost and the net income was JPY billion but we have secured the profits There are several factors One thing that's the  environment was remarkably favorable but at the same time and the continued improvements of the profitability of domestic P&C and the life  overseas operations also have contributed And then based on this the  performance and the market environment we have upwardly revisions revised the forecast and including of all this the  gains now we have improved ordinary profit by JPY billion to JPY billion and also you we have upward revised in net income by JPY billion This is the actual  performance numbers Net premium income they have increased by % including the  Japan Nipkoa and tima in Brazil and also that pius and with the P&L has been consolidated since first half When it comes to ordinary profit and the net income we already have presented that our domestic P&C  have contributed a lot on the ordinary profits Let me explain in details Would you please page four First of all this is the breakdown of unwriting profit and excluding the inaudible core unwriting of profits improved by the JPY billion yearon-year basis to JPY billion as unwriting profits in first and a half Catastrophic loss reserve has mixed impact on unwriting profits an additional provision for the automobile  is due to the progress of the claim as a payment was negative and impact of reversal of the reserve had a positive impact for that to snow damages On page five this is the breakdown of ordinary profits  factors for this have been the double of the ordinary profits and for number one an improvement of that unwriting profits Number two now we have the gains on the  due to that favorable  environment And the number three is that incremental profits from Himawari   Then page six represents the net income Just like this  billion  Japan Nipkoa and  billion for Himawari   and overseas subsidiaries JPY billion and they're all contributed to the JPY billion of the income Now on page page seven and now we have the heavy financial cost on that as a onetime merger cost and as an extraordinarily loss so let me explain about it That one-time merger cost we are watching in a couple of plan amounted to JPY billion where that system costs that's the primary the cost factors And we have recognized about JPY billion of this the one-time merger cost so that the balance of JPY billion of the cost would be recognized after the Q by the end of this fiscal year Next page eight this is about the revision of the forecast of  and would you please look at the numbers ahead And this is the revision based on the favorable  environment and another  environment Let explain in details And this is the breakdown of ordinary profit for the annual  forecast The core unwriting profits have expanded further from the first half to JPY billion On the other hand due to the improved profitability of automobile  we need to provide that additional -- this catastrophic reserves So this means that we have a decrease in the reversal from this reserve When it comes to the gains from the s we have incorporated the situation in the end of September and increased by JPY billion Forecast for the Himawari   and obviously the operations also revised upwardly Consequently and our forecast was the JPY billion and it was increased by JPY billion from the previous forecast and JPY billion year-over-year basis Next would you please go to page  This is the trend of premiums on the performance evaluation basis Would you please check out that the trend is upward Now the incremental ratio is % with  indicated that net premium written and end of the first half it was plus % And the rest of the increase in the fire  is high but this is due to that -- now that we have been favorable and in household to corporate and also unwriting the re and also in the automobile  we have favorable effect from that changing that ratio and then other new types of  including liability  We have a large contracts and it had been very steady Page  represents the loss ratio and written loss ratio have risen from % to % in the first half due to the payment for the snow damage but excluding the natural disaster and this reference ratio had been kept improving Page  represents that loss ratio on an earned and incurred basis has been flat in the first half with % annually Now we expected improvements from the % from the half to the % As for the second half of FY  we've been conservative in estimating about our expansion of  of untaking re  in overseas market or the incremental outstanding will also result but due to the depreciation of the Yen And then also our estimates are that the loss on those large worth contracts of the new types of  Taking all these included that we have been whether conservative Page  that represents the net expense ratio Expense ratios have steadily decd where the primary factor of the labor cost decd and now and in the first half we have improved by % to % and annually we planned to dec up to % Page  this shows the combined ratio This is the combining that the written loss ratio and expense ratios and would you please check out to the figures and annually it will be % Page  indicated the combined ratio for the automobile  and this is due to the revision of the premium rates or the revision on the driver rating and those have a revision have contributed to the improvements steadily and combined ratio in the first half is % this is  point improvement but annually now we have the forecast with annually for the % flat from the first half and we expected  points as improvements On page  we can find out the trend of the number of reported claims histoally The number of reported claims has been steady and we assumed the p of that reason for this might include reducing number of low value decs due to the revision of the driver race and in Q it was minus % Next please look at page  for the  profit The  profit is trending relatively high reflecting the high stock pes and also the weak Yen The total  profit recorded for the first half was JPY billion As for the gain on securities sales we've reduced the exposure of JPY billion for strategic holding stocks Among this the actual stock sales was JPY billion and we are proceeding with this very steadily As for the forecast of the full year we have added net interest and divid income as well as gain on securities sales And now we are forecasting JPY billion as a result Please turn to page  this is regarding the forecast for the P&C  Please confirm the details later This time we're looking at the  unwriting profit it is minus JPY billion compared to the previous forecast We are very steady here but when it comes to the loss reserves and also reversal of the provisions which has gone down we beve that we should be conservative for the second half This is reflected into the numbers here Therefore in terms of the  profit this is the p where we have revised upwards We have calculated the numbers according to this thinking At this point if there is any uncertainties it will be the reduction of the corporate tax If this happens that impact has not been reflected into these numbers Now please turn to page  I would like to add some information regarding natural disasters For the first half we had impact from typhoon number  and torrential rain from ma Prefecture but the incurred losses totaled JPY billion Even if we take into  the typhoon number  and number  which occurred in October we do not expect to achieve  billion Our initial forecast for this fiscal year So our revised forecast is now JPY billion Please turn to page  this is the snow damage from February In the first half we have a positive effect of JPY billion due to the reversal of outstanding reserves And the remaining outstanding loss reserve is JPY billion as of September end mainly related to corporate properties but we plan to complete payments by the end of this fiscal year Now I would like to talk about the life   which sts from page  So for both premium in-force and MCEV these are both trending well please confirm those points Moving on to page  we have the premiums and various other figures And because we're doing well with the sales of medical  products the annualized new premium is going to go up dramatically For FY' we expect the annualized net premium to reach JPY billion up % year-on-year As for the ordinary profit and net income we looked at the first half results and decided to upward revise our numbers The amount of  in force continues to increase mainly due to the protection type products Next please turn to page  this is regarding the payment method at Himawari  As for the payment method this excludes the lump-sum payment so basically it is the installment payment which is growing in the base Page  this is the sales from the P&C  channel it's growing steadily and the protection type products now comprise about % of the total products and this level has been maintained Please turn to Page  this is regarding the J-GAAP profits As for the first half basic profit and net income both trended very well In the first half basic profit was JPY billion which is JPY billion up and the net income was JPY billion which is JPY billion up The  side is also good but also related to the medical  related new products there is some movements in the switchover to new products And so therefore we have some technical issues that helped push the profit up Technically the reversal of  provision due to surrens from existing products is the cause Looking at the first half numbers for the full-year estimate we have a basic profit of JPY billion which is JPY billion up and net income JPY billion which is JPY billion up Please turn to page  this is MCEV for your reference As for the full year growth and adjusted EV this is JPY billion which is still a very high level of continued growth Initially we actually showed you the guide of JPY billion but this reflects the switchover to new medical  products as I mentioned earr As for the EV as of the end of this fiscal year it is expected to reach JPY billion From page  and on we talk about our overseas  The overseas  is good in the first half The net premiums written was JPY billion with the impact of pius included into our consolidated P&L numbers and also the Brazil tima impact we have a very good increase in the income For the full-year we expect an incremental growth close to JPY billion to achieve JPY billion As for the net income it has increased to JPY billion from JPY billion last year due to good  in pius and also Turkey Singapore and also for the full-year performance we have revised the net income to JPY billion up JPY billion from the beginning of this fiscal year Please turn to Page  this is by geography The top  grew in  and South  and for the net income  and  has made a good contribution So please confirm these points Page  we have some numbers by company companies in our  Please turn to  this is showing the asset  portfolio as of September end Please look at page  for non-life and page  for life es For both life and non-life there has been no change in our  policy The asset portfolio as of September end had some changes due to higher stock pes and the weak yen but when you look at it in comparison to the end of h there has been no big changes As for the duration it tends to be slightly long for liability for both non-life and life We will continue to  our s with a focus on profitability and also stability and liquidity At the very end I'd like to talk to Page  This adjusted performance has been shown here reflected in our   numeal targets When you look at the number second  from the  you can see that we had ed for  in the beginning but now it's up to  And also the ROE is up from % to % This concludes my presentation Questions And Answers,today conference call today performance today revision forecast document information page format meeting meeting
