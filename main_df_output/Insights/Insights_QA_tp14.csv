We've issued an unqualified audit opinion on these financial statements dated March 31, 2019. You can find our audit reports on the Pages 324 to 332 of the annual report. The materiality determines the scope and depth of our audit work. We have set our materiality level at EUR 78 million, which is a decrease compared to the materiality level of EUR 90 million used in our 2017 audit. Consistent with last year, it has been calculated as 5% of the 3 year average of income before tax excluding the 2016 loss on the sale to the U.K. annuities business. We also take potential statements into account that in our adjustment are material for qualitative reasons. We agree with the Supervisory Board that we would report to them the statements identified during audit above EUR 4 million. We established our scope based on the way Aegon is organized. We performed audit work on all in-scope regional units where Aegon has operations, which included the Americas, Netherlands, U.K., Central and Eastern Europe, Spain and Portugal, Asia and Aegon Asset Management. In Americas, Netherlands and U.K., due to the relative size, we performed full scope audits, while in CEE, Spain and Portugal, Asia and Aegon Asset Management, we performed audit procedures over specific account balances. Our coverage amounted to 95% for revenues, 97% for total assets and 98% for profit before tax. We ensured that the audit teams, both at group consolidation and at component levels had the appropriate skills and competencies, which are needed for the audit of a complex financial conglomerate such as Aegon. This included industry expertise in the life and nonlife insurance, banking and asset management. In our team, we, therefore, included specialists and experts in areas of risk assurance, IT, tax actuarial services, human resource services. And valuation services for certain type of assets. Given the importance of the information technology for the group and hence for our audit of the financial statements, we have to the extent relevant to our audit paid specific attention to IT general controls, which comprised the policies and procedures to ensure reliable automated processing of information, useful financials reporting purposes, relevant application controls and IT dependencies. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management overwrite of internal controls including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by management that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. In our analysis of fraud risk factors, we were supportive by our forensic specialists. Then the key audit matters. Key audit matters are the most important matters we have identified in our audit plan and in our audit work during the year. We have identified 4 key audit matters, which I will comment upon briefly. Compared to prior year, we combined the 2 that relate to the valuation of insurance contracts and the valuation of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired as these matters and our work performed are closely related. We excluded the one that related to the U.S. tax reform as it had less impact this year. The fourth related to outsourcing is new. Let's start with this one. In 2018, Aegon outsourced a large part of the policy administration of its insurance annuity business lines in America through a third party. As Aegon's outsourcing strategy further developed in 2018 and the services outsourced have a significant impact on the group's financial statements and operations, we determined this as a key audit matter. A critical element through the successful execution of Aegon's processes is to adequately design the appropriate monetary controls and governance over these outsourced services. We evaluated the scope of the service providers' auditor's report and assessed the reputation, objectivity and competence of the service provider's auditor. We evaluated the control objectives and control activities in the report, which are relevant to Aegon's internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we evaluated the design and tested the existence and operating effectiveness of controls implemented by Aegon to monitor the outsourced services. The second one relates to the valuation of asset and liabilities arising out of insurance contracts. Liabilities arising out of insurance contracts is the most significant liabilities on an insurance company's balance sheet. Deferred policy acquisition costs are upfront costs associated with writing an insurance contract, which have capitalized an expense over the life of the insurance contract. These assets and liabilities require significant judgment in respect of the valuation. We used our own actuaries to assist us in all these balances. We assessed whether the methods, data and assumptions used by Aegon to determine these assets and liabilities are suitable, accurate, reliable and relevant. The third point relates to the fair value of hard to value financial instruments. This matter is related to investments that are illiquid and this requires significant judgment from Aegon management in determining their valuation. We use our own valuation specialist to assist us in auditing the calculations and accessing the adjustment made and assumptions used by Aegon. The fourth one relates to uncertainties in policyholder claims and litigation. The insurance industry continues to face consumer activism and regulatory scrutiny over product design and selling practices. Aegon has encountered claims and litigation in this respect. We assessed the company's position on these matters including underlying facts and circumstances by obtaining lawyers' letters to the extent considered necessary for audits as well as assessing the need to record a liability and the required disclosures. Most key audit matters have been selected as they contain a significant level of management judgment. Based on our procedures performed, we concur with management estimate -assessment. Then the order information including the directors' reports. With respect to the audit information included in the Annual Report, based on our knowledge and understanding obtained during our audits, we have concluded that is consistent with the financial statements, does not contain material misstatement and it contains all information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The scope of these procedures was substantially less than the scope of procedures performed in our audits.

I'm pleased to take this opportunity to explain our involvement as external auditors. I'm Devitt, I'm an audit partner for KPMG. And I'm the auditor signed off. So you -the statement at independent auditor's report for the 2016 annual report was indeed signed by me on 15 March 2017. 2016 was the first year that KPMG did the audit, as the Chairman just said. We've been relieved of our nondisclosure obligation. So I'll -- I'm free to elaborate on the audit that we performed. Now, what did we audit. Pursuant to our instructions, we audited the consolidated and parent company annual accounts in accordance with Dutch law and issued a statement of unqualified approval for these financial statements. Please note that in 2016, we evaluated the quarterly figures of NN Group. And we also issued unqualified statements of approval for these quarterly figures. We also assess the nonfinancial information, often qualified as sustainability information as contained by the NN Group's annual report. And once again, there was a statement of unqualified approval. Finally, the statements by the NN Group in the annual review including those relating to corporate governance, we read them and based on our knowledge and understanding, gleaned through auditing the annual report. We did not see any material conflicts with the financial statements we had reviewed. The legally required information is included in the annual review and we've stated that in our audit statement as well. Now I'd like to tell you what's in our audit statement on Pages 163 through 171 of the financial report statement consist of various elements. Based on our duties, we have concluded that the financial statements offer an accurate reflection of the financial position on 31 December 2016 and the results throughout the year 2016. And these financial statements were drafted based on the assumption of continuous operations and based on our duties, we have concluded that this assumption by the management is appropriate. Then there's something about impartiality and independence of the fact that this was our first audit. Globally, we're independent of the NN Group and all subsidiaries. And that's been the case since 1 October 2015. I just said 2016 was the first year that we audited the NN Group's annual accounts. And we got off to a timely start and in the run-up to the first year audit, we did additional duty such as attending important meetings with the previous auditor and assessing the records of their audit to understand how they did it and we conducted a lot of conversations with the management and the Supervisory Board as well as with staff of the NN Group and with the regulator     and the run up. In our audit responsibilities, we consulted them too. And determining our audit approach materiality is an important concept. And that's been explained in our statement as well. This materiality level was EUR 120 million in 2016. This is an important quantitative materiality but of course, there are other items where we were more meticulous for qualitative reasons. For example, the recent explanation about the remuneration of the Executive and Supervisory Boards. Of course, those explanations require a high level of accuracy. At the end, we reported all differences observed in writing above the materiality level to the Supervisory and Executive Boards. Now the scope of our work, in addition to being external auditors for the NN in the Netherlands, we're the external auditors for all countries where the NN operates. And we determine where and in what depth the audit is necessary. And we assess the outcome of the auditors and discuss them with our teams on site as well as with local management and the management at the group in The Hague. In addition, each year, we visit some countries and assess the records of the local audits. This year, we did this in Japan, Spain, Poland and Greece. Our international operations ensure proper coverage throughout the NN Group. In carrying out our duties, we focus mainly on the significant risks. And a significant risk is acknowledged by us as a risk where the discrepancy is of material importance. And we devote special attention to that in our audit. With significant risks, these entail significant nonroutine transactions or matters that would require evaluations by the management. Often they are identified as estimates. And we gained insight into the internal control measures at the NN Group to identify the details of these risks. We also perform specific duties to ascertain that the risks would not ultimately lead to a discrepancy of material importance in the financial statements. The 4 significant risks then carried over to the key audit matters. And we've included 4 in our statement. I'll walk you through them. First, the uncertainty that the estimate for insurance and control liability for insurance control liabilities then there's -- the access to IT systems and the final concerns, the explanation of Solvency II. There's also unit-linked exposure. And you can read the description of the risks and the duties we performed to mitigate that risk. Our duties provide a foundation to conclude that the annual report, as a whole, provides an accurate impression based on which you may reach your own conclusion. And I'll hand you back to the Chairman at that. +++qanda",   Good afternoon everybody I'm pleased to take this opporty to explain our involvement as external auditors I'm  I'm an audit pner for KPMG

Of course, I'm extremely curious what Delta Lloyd's books look like. But that will figure in our audit for 2017 and our assessment duty. So I told you that we assess the quarterly figures every quarter. I just indicated that the half-year figures are the first consolidated ones at the NN Group, including Delta Lloyd, those are Delta Lloyd. And I'm sure you'll find our statement of -- you'll find our auditor statement there, too. And next year we'll be able to tell you more about Delta Lloyd, specifically, to the extent that matters were relevant for compiling the financial statements in 2016. We've included them. That's mainly a textual explanation. And we've also assessed whether the source documents were properly substantiated.",   Well those are several questions Let me circumscribe things first I'm talking about the audit of the financial statements of the NN  in  up to the events in mid-h  And ta Lloyd  compiled its own financial statements and had a different auditor it wasn't KPMG And their auditor will have to explain that auditor statement Of course I'm extremely curious what ta Lloyd's books look like But that will figure in our audit for  and our assessment duty So I told you that we assess the querly figures every quer I just indicated that the half-year figures are the first consolidated ones at the NN  including ta Lloyd those are ta Lloyd And I'm sure you'll find our statement of -- you'll find our auditor statement there too And next year we'll be able to tell you more about ta Lloyd specifically to the extent that matters were relet for compiling the financial statements in  We've included them That's mainly a textual explanation And we've also assessed whether the source documents were properly substantiated,question thing audit statement event statement auditor auditor auditor statement book audit assessment duty figure quer year figure one statement auditor statement year extent matter statement explanation source document,"['audit', 'statement', 'statement', 'auditor', 'auditor', 'auditor', 'statement', 'audit', 'assessment', 'duty', 'statement', 'auditor', 'statement', 'matter', 'statement', 'explanation', 'source', 'document']",28,189,15,6.75,1.8666666666666667,18,0.0032227207,0.004559322,0.009358783,0.0057410067,0.002111964,0.003195162,0.00478076,0.004816462,0.0049919426,0.0067814407,0.0052100285,0.006416551,0.05401948,0.82453865,0.0069786413,0.0034593167,0.004699967,0.007966145,0.005649817,0.0025062962,0.0053457804,0.0039571496,0.0005918316,0.004473111,0.0036596926,0.00463424,0.006333776,topic_14

You'll see an extensive report of the audit and risk committee in the annual report on Pages 126 and 127. In addition, I'd like to bring a few items to your consideration here. First, I'll tell you that conversations with our external auditor, Maarten Koning, we discussed ﬁnance risk management and audit of the ﬁnancial statements. They were constructive and open and that certainly beneﬁts the work we have to do. And I believe that, that's mutual both for the external auditor and to us as a committee. Each year, the external auditor issues a management letter reporting the observations at a.s.r. with respect to administrative organization and internal control. We discuss this memo with the a.s.r. management and are adhering to the follow-up of improvements to be made. In the previous management letter for the past year, there were no serious issues throughout the organization. There were focused actions, for example, of that individual procedures or a speciﬁc product. And the positive remark of EY in the management letter, which was that a.s.r. generally has well-functioning internal control is certainly worth sharing with you. EY's audit for the previous ﬁnancial year revealed a few discrepancies, which were discussed within the auditing risk committee and obviously on the supervisory board as well. These discrepancies were cumulative. But immaterial. A special consideration of the auditing risk committee was also dedicated to the integration of Generali Nederlands, which was quite aggressive and to ensure that the ﬁnancial targets of the acquisition were exceeded. In its meetings, the committee regularly exchanged ideas with actuaries and oﬃcials about the estimates underlying the biggest item on our balance sheet in addition to investments, which concerns insurance obligations. And we noted that these estimates and assumptions were devised carefully and prudently. As was mentioned, nowadays there's a lot of interest in fraud. That's a major concern. For years, the committee receives a report from the compliant section every quarter and as needed. It's discussed with the management with consideration for the nature of frequency and what measures were taken to avert any fraud issues identiﬁed. Special consideration of the committee was also allocated in 2018 to cyber risks, compliance with sanctions and progress toward preparing Company Name ASR Nederland NV for IFRS 17 and 9, which are important for insurance. With regard to the ﬁrst 2 topics, a.s.r. is operating adequately and as far as IFRS 17 and 9, IFRS is on track. And the ﬁnal point as I did last year, I'd like to call your attention to Page 102 in the annual report, which reﬂects the risk priorities, the most serious risks that a.s.r. faces, listed as the management has observed, which -- and the mitigating measures by a.s.r. to control these risks as well as possible are indicated there as well.

8001,Maarten Koning,20190522_ASR_Nederland_NV-_Shareholder_Mtg_Call_2019-5-22_SD000000002905465589.pdf,2019-05-22,1022.0,0,1,ASR Nederland,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity to address you and tell you about the audit and results for 2018. I'm Maarten Koning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm the EY auditor. And I'm responsible for auditing a.s.r. I prepared a presentation that should not exceed 10 minutes. And I'd like to tell you about the audit and scope of the strategy and its implementation as well as the results and the key what it matters as well as some other current themes, such as cyber risks and operations addressing fraud and noncompliance with legislation regulations as well as privacy. Those are current themes. And I'm going to wrap up with our communication interaction with a.s.r. and the executive and supervisory boards. First, the scope. We audited the corporate and the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of a.s.r. and examined whether the annual report meets legal requirements, whether the content corresponds with our impression of the ﬁnancial statements and whether the annual report aligns with our knowledge of the organization. Those are the legal requirements to audit a.s.r. In addition, the ﬁrm asked us to do some other things, including the CSR report with sustainability information. We assessed that and issued a separate statement about that. We were also involved in the release of press releases about the year ﬁgures. And we also assessed the half-year ﬁgures for 2018. As stated, I am the responsible auditor. I don't work alone. I have a huge team, very broad with many specialists, including IT auditors and tax specialists. Please note that we also assign other specialists, especially valuation experts that's to audit the investments in companies not listed on the stock exchange, monitoring property investments, goodwill and other intangible ﬁxed assets. We use many actuaries in auditing an insurance company, especially to evaluate technical provisions and Solvency II ﬁgures. And we also assign EY forensic service specialists to do justice to our responsibility concerning fraud and considering legislation and regulations in the audits. We also work closely with the internal audit service of a.s.r. and coordinate targets in subordinate investigations and share our ﬁndings. Now materiality. Our audit is intended to yield the high degree of certainty that the ﬁnancial statements provide an accurate impression. This means that the ﬁnancial statements need to be drafted according to the applicable standards of IFRS as led by EU and the Dutch Civil Code 92 to ensure no material errors. The materiality is the Company Name ASR Nederland NV designation of the threshold for discrepancies in the ﬁgures that we consider acceptable. The materiality that we have applied in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of a.s.r. is EUR 36 million. Discrepancies above that amount might impact the impression of the annual ﬁnancial statements. This materiality is the same as last year and is based on approximately 5% of the operating results. There may be smaller errors in the audit and any errors above EUR 1.8 million are discussed with the supervisory board. Now execution of the audit. To that end, we use various audit teams. Checking for example, ASR life insurance, ASR nonlife, ASR banks. And we evaluate their duties and results will follow reviewing the reports in various meetings. As for the scope of the audit because most of these company participating in a.s.r. are supervised institutions and require an audit also according to the Dutch National Bank, we achieve a balance sheet total of 95% in our audit concerning the operating result. Now the ﬁndings and our conclusions. We have issued an unqualiﬁed audit opinion for both the consolidated and the corporate ﬁnancial statements, which mean that they reﬂect an accurate impression according to IFRS and as led by the EU and Dutch Civil Code 92. In addition, we consider continuity in our statement. We have a special clause on continuity. The a.s.r. management compiled the ﬁnancial statements. Based on the principle of continuity, we have evaluated this assumption in part by examining the liquidity planning for the coming year, the proﬁt potential that was in funding plan of the ﬁrm and solvency progression. We did not identify any uncertainties of material importance that would lead us to have justiﬁed us about the application of continuity principle. As for the sustainability information in the annual report, we issued an unqualiﬁed audit opinion meaning that based on our duties, the sustainability information did not prove to be an inaccurate depiction of a.s.r.'s policy and operations relating to sustainability and the results achieved in 2018 of this in accordance with the reporting criteria selected by the global reporting initiative. And we evaluated the reliability as a material customer indicators such as customer satisfaction, customer focus and sustainable investments as well as long-term value creation in 2019. We have also considered the succession -- we have also considered whether a.s.r. follows up on upcoming legislation concerning sustainable ﬁnance. And now key audit matters. On this list, you see our key audit matters. Our audit approach ﬁrst of all is top down and risk based. We identify where the chance of material errors is most likely in the ﬁnancial statements and do more work in those ﬁelds than in others. And we do our risk assessment at the start of the audit year and update it continuously according to the audit plan, which we discuss with the auditing risk committee. The auditing risk committee agreed to the audit plan. So we reported on underlying risks as well as our duties. Now the most important key audit matters or highlights in the audit are on this slide. I'm not going to cover them individually. But -- because many are identical to those last year. I would just like to tell you about the main changes. The main change is a new one and that's the classiﬁcation of ASR Bank and concerning the -- as held for sale and discontinued operation. And a.s.r. has to meet a speciﬁc provision, which is a complex standard that sets speciﬁc requirements for evaluating the held-for-sale assets and Company Name ASR Nederland NV liabilities as explained in the annual report. ASR Bank at the end of 2018 in keeping with IFRS 5 was evaluated on the balance sheet at the lowest book value and the fair value. In our audit, we used IFRS specialist to review whether a.s.r. meets the IFRS provisions and check the book value, which consists mainly mortgages and savings deposits. We validated the fair value determination with management based on what was received and conducted the audit. Based on our duties, we conclude that the classiﬁcation of ASR Bank was correct at the end of 2018 corresponds with IFRS 5. We agree with the justiﬁed impairment and are conﬁdent that the disclosure requirements are being met. Now Generali was one of the core issues in our audit. It was already discussed. We examined the acquisition balance sheet as well as the purchase price allocation or PPA of Generali Netherlands, focusing mainly on the largest estimate in the calculation, which is the fair value of the technical facilities. And we signed our own actuaries to examine that and checked whether all the IFRS 3 disclosures are being made. We ascertained that the management did an accurate evaluation of the acquisition balance sheet of Generali and met the requirements for the PPA as well. As for other highlights that you've been seeing for several years and that are logical for an insurance company, which are the evaluation of technical provisions. In the context of evaluating technical provisions and determining adequacy, according to IFRS, according to the provision of Solvency II, the best estimate liabilities, a.s.r. is required to estimate noneconomic liabilities for life insurance, mortality and there is also redemption for cancellation. Those are the most signiﬁcant estimates in life insurance. As for nonlife, this includes disability insurance, give assumptions about invalidity, rehabilitation, inﬂow and outﬂow, post reports, major claims and settlement pattern from previous nonlife years estimated according to the most recent nonlife year. In keeping with the audit standard of COS 540, we asked our actuaries to apply benchmarks and determine bandwidths for estimates. Based on  Aaron's  assessment, we're convinced that the foundations applied by a.s.r. and the estimates in evaluating and determining technical provisions have been established according to IFRS and Solvency II. Given the internal challenges in the methods and assumptions, we observed a healthy and transparent discussion between the ﬁrst and second line of a.s.r. Now I'm going to say a bit about several current themes. First, cyber risks. Part of our work with our IT auditors is to gain insight into a.s.r.'s risk management with respect to cybersecurity. a.s.r. measures about this assumed curtailment of intervention as well as mitigation external threats as well as resilience in the event that they actually occur. This risk is continuously present and it's progressive. So that's why we discuss this risk at length with the auditing risk committee. Now about fraud. We adhere to the COS 240 audit standards in fraud. We perform speciﬁc procedures to address the required fraud risk management. And we also assess processes and measures taken by a.s.r. to manage internal and external fraud risks. We also evaluate a.s.r.'s compliance and integrity framework based in part on subordinate observations. And we discuss quarterly reports for integrity with the compliance and security department. So we're supported by a forensic auditor. And we discuss the fraud risk with the auditing risk committee. Company Name ASR Nederland NV As for compliance with legislation regulation, we do these duties in keeping with Standard 250. We identify the existence and structure of the measure that a.s.r. has introduced to ensure compliance with reading, correspondence with regulators as well as integrity and legal aﬀairs quarterly reports and minutes and interview management. Now the ﬁnal current theme is privacy. You are aware that as of 25 May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation became eﬀective in such organizations and the GDPR provides an explicit duty of care in processing personal data. In 2017, a.s.r. introduced a vast program to meet GDPR rules and monitoring now takes place based on compliance, privacy risks and incidents reported to the privacy oﬃcer and the management. And a.s.r. addressed this in detail on Page 106 of the annual report. Now ﬁnally, communication and interaction. It's already been asserted that in our audit we use internal control measures that a.s.r. has implemented. a.s.r. has 3 lines of defense in internal control measures to ensure eﬀectiveness of the internal control measures. And we have reviewed this and tested using the 4 key functions at a.s.r. the risk management function and internal actuarial function, internal audit function and compliance function. They report and we review the reports. And we report any additional ﬁndings and observations in our management letter and audit reports. We've already covered this. Now to wrap up, I would qualify our relationship with management as open. We also have a transparent relationship with the audit and risk committee and the supervisory board and frequently report our ﬁndings both in writing and orally. We have ascertained that management, the auditing risk committee takes our observation seriously and follows up on them adequately. Finally, we depend on the company and adhere to speciﬁc EU legislation -- no, we're independent of the ﬁrm. We did not do any consulting. We merely provided the audits including the statutory ﬁnancial statements and QRTs and related audit services to provide the required reports. Thank you very much for listening.
