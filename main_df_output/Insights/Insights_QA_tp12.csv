What sort of metrics would you focus on, would it be cash, operating profit, OCG? What will make you decide that these are the businesses you need to keep and these are the businesses that you don't need to keep? So that could be the first one. Second thing is, can we get some sense on local solvency ratios to understand how the remittances are going to look like for second half of this year and how comfortable you are on the full year remittance for next year? Because clearly, I mean remittances is very important and given that you are planning that you haven't taken out any remittance in first half, it will be good to get some color on how we should think about like second half and next year? And just last one is, sorry, going back to the dividend topic, I mean you mentioned that there will be -- there has been a first interim, second interim and there will be a final dividend. But any color on what should it be based on, should it be based on IFRS earnings, should it be based on Solvency II capital generation, what metrics do we need to focus on or should it be based on remittance basis?

Excluding Farmers and also probably LatAm as well, the underlying businesses are probably – there's probably a large chunk of that that's making low-single-digit kind of levels. So just interested know where is the most room to improve the underperforming units, if possible please. And then secondly around that sort of local view versus global units, I'm just interested to know about direct platforms versus kind of a more local view.

The operating result went up and we're making good progress on reducing expenses in line with our strategic focus.

The 2014 is the momentous for us on first fronts various fronts, including the IPO and successful debt issues, but also because we are proposing our first dividend, which we hope that our shareholders will approve at the Annual Meeting in May.

So let's start with the cash remittance, a reference been made to Slide 11. And reference also has been made, what you said, Rene, to the segment and segment profits. The remittance has smaller than the IFRS, has much more to do with local accounts because it's basically cash is remitted from the local and statutory accounts more than from IFRS profits. And there's the prudence principles in statutory accounts and the best estimate principle in IFRS. With regards to restraints that was a part of your question, we have not had restraints in the local statutory accounts with regard to cash remittance in 2020. Now with regards to the composition and trends, what we have put a strong emphasis on since the beginning of Simply Safe Season 1 is that we do have cash remittance from all major business segments, meaning life, non-life and the asset management and banking area which we have achieved. There is a little bit of movement year-on-year. But what's important is that we are on the trajectory to reach the first CHF2 billion.

Just asking about the remittance ratio and the remittances to the holding company. I guess, you're adjusting the shareholder structure or the group structure, the financial structure of the group. And given the solvency move -- has moved for this quarter, has there been any impact on the remittance profile of the group? The second thing is just again on the remittance. Is the remittance following the organic capital generation of the group, or is it exceeding the capital generation? And just third question, you make a point with regards to the current yield on your book. But what is the economic reinvestment rate? Are they now above the previous reinvestment rates or below the reinvestment rates? This is on an economic basis.

But the main contributors to the increase in the solvency ratio, obviously, come from the increase in the strong  10916  fees in the capital. And the main contributors there are obviously the profit indeed in Belgium which was significantly high. Also additional unrealized capital gains which we booked on the property portfolio which amount close to €100 million, slightly above €100 million. And let's also not forget that the equity market in Belgium did well and also there, although our portfolio is limited, we had additional capital gains on that. And indeed, your question on dividend is relevant because this one does not have the dividend accrual in it, whereas the end-of-year figure did have the dividend accrual. And these are the most important components of the move.",   I have the answer but only pially for you because I actually have not all the figures it's up by region on the movement But the main contributors to the increase in the solvency ratio obviously come from the increase in the strong    fees in the capital And the main contributors there are obviously the profit indeed in Belgium which was significantly high Also additional unrealized capital gains which we booked on the property portfolio which amount close to € million slightly above € million And let's also not forget that the equity market in Belgium did well and also there although our portfolio is ed we had additional capital gains on that And indeed your question on divid is relet because this one does not have the divid accrual in it whereas the end-of-year figure did have the divid accrual And these are the most important coments of the move,answer figure region movement contributor increase solvency ratio increase fee capital contributor profit capital gain property portfolio equity market portfolio capital gain question one divid accrual end year figure divid accrual coment move,"['region', 'contributor', 'contributor', 'accrual', 'accrual', 'coment']",30,201,8,6.7,3.75,6,0.0076656956,0.01084499,0.022261186,0.013655794,0.0050236043,0.0076001436,0.011371712,0.011456634,0.011874039,0.016130613,0.012392787,0.70458317,0.013606201,0.008206518,0.016599683,0.008228473,0.011179534,0.0189486,0.013438887,0.005961579,0.012715694,0.009412638,0.0014077548,0.010639926,0.008705095,0.011023194,0.015065779,topic_12
