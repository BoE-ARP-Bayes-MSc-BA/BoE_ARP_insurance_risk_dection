This is now not something that I'm personally tracking, but when you look at our sensitivity at group level, we have a sensitivity, which is, as of Q1, minus 7%. The numbers of Allianz Leven are included there. There is also a mechanism where sometimes the sensitivity maybe at Allianz Leven  011404  might be higher compared to the sensitivity that we see at group level because of the impact of transferability. But I would say that Allianz Leven with a solvency ratio of about 400% is very well capitalized. And also what we do, we do this for all companies, and we do this also for Allianz Leven.

I must say, we will not start making predictions on that. I mean, Solvency II sensitivities we disclosed at the Investor Day and that is as far as we want to go. It's not because Solvency II ratios are going to be slightly more volatile that every time our market rate moves, we should go into recalculating old ratios. That is not the purpose. And the fact of the matter is that we defined our risk appetite. We have assessed the sensitivities that we can tolerate and would tolerate in our business and that is the way we have settled our Solvency II management framework. But referring to what we disclosed during the Investor Day regarding sensitivities on solvency, of course, you can see that there – I cannot refer to a slide, but it's in the pack of information that we distributed during the Investor Day – that sensitivities to equity exposure from the Solvency II ratio of Ageas Consolidated Insurance is actually quite low, yeah? It's quite low. It's actually almost nil for the simple reason that the exposure of our main portfolio within Ageas is not as high. That's one, two because part of the impact on Solvency II of equity movements is absorbed by the non-transferable part belonging to the BNP share. So that dampens that quite significantly. On the yield curve and the spread, the sensitivity is higher. We even said that, if we – if interest rates would go down 1%, we could see a drop in Solvency ratio of about 20 bps. Also, that is not related so much to mismatch because we know that our books are matched. So it's not related to the own front loss. It's more related through the increase of the SCR because of the low portion of loss absorption in there, not the profit-sharing feature. So it is more an increasing SCR than a lot of old funds because the Ageas book is matched quite well. And, of course, after a while, that would recover. The third one on spread, we did a test and we disclosed that, saying, okay, if we stress test our ratio with 75% of the standard form and the capital charges, if we say, okay, let's  5443  us with 75% of that to have a reference, then we would see the ratio come down with about 10% on spread. That spread, of course, if it does not materialize – I mean, if it does not materialize in real losses, it will come back after a few periods. In the next year, it will add to the profit and loss.

I would have thought there would be a U.K. government cap on any equity release assets in the U.K. and you couldn't rate any AAA on that basis. The questions I guess are, on the 150% after 2001, 2002 scenario, I appreciate the comments that, I guess, several of the people have made, that doesn't feel like particularly onerous stress. But clearly, in that scenario, the business is more sensitive. So to say you have GBP 4 billion of surplus, clearly the scenarios and sensitivity test clearly all go through roof.

At the end of the year, like you said, it was $6.9 billion, but for December 31, but the average for the quarter would have been less. And now, we had this  March  at $6.1 billion, but what we've said for some time is we're selling our long treasury bonds and you've got about 2.5 points, maybe even a little more, that you lose when you go from a long treasury to short-term two-year rates of 0.25%. That's two-year rates and five years rates of course, are just -- treasury is at 0.8, 0.82, 0.83 -- so really very, very low rates compared to the past. And with -- we've got the $6.1 billion. We think of it as opportunistic, so we don't make -we're not trying to raise cash. We're just taking advantage of the fact that spreads have come down and so we're selling our corporate bonds. Treasury rates have come down. Last year, long treasuries were the best asset to have and so we've sold half our treasuries we told you, long treasuries, and we continue to sell it. We likely won't have any treasuries soon and so we're continuing to sell that, the long treasury position. And so our interest and dividend income will come down and our -- one thing we won't do is reach for yield because we think this is not a good time to reach for yield. The spreads are very narrow again, and in fact, people who have reached for yield might suffer, as they have had in 2008, 2009, when spreads widened. So right now, we're just -- we've very long term, Tom, so we think of this as long term, but a month from now or next week, who knows?

And in terms of how high the buﬀers will be, it is -- there are individual buﬀers on many of these -- in many of these products, so it will very much depend on the diﬀerent categories of products and customer groups. The more buﬀer we have, the more risk we can take on behalf of our customers in order to achieve a better expected return, which is good for customers and also protects shareholders' equity. So we will continue to build buﬀers where we can. And some places where buﬀers are full, which will depend on the diﬀerent product categories, we will not continue to build buﬀers. But within the guaranteed portfolios, we have a risk management strategy that tries to optimize this on behalf of customers and, at the same time, protecting shareholders. And in terms of the solvency buildup, you are correct, starting at 168% and then building 6% to 7% per year. It's an easy equation to see how far you can get. And the toolbox, as I said, will allow us to improve solvency by at least 10 percentage points on top of that. So it's a matter of when and if we use that toolbox in order to achieve the 180% and start the share buyback. It's a lot of discussion about 2022 or 2023. Of course, we, the management and the Board likes to do what is necessary to start that share buybacks as soon as possible. So this is just a projection based on where we are today, what the generation of solvencies.

This is not something that I personally tracking. But when you look at our sensitivity at group level, we have a sensitivity which is, as of Q1, minus 7%. The numbers of Allianz Leben are included there. There's also a mechanism where sometimes the sensitivity maybe at Allianz Leben might be higher compared to the sensitivity that we see at group level, because of the impact of transferability. But I will say that Allianz Leben, with the solvency ratio of about 400%, is very well capitalized. And also, what we do, we do this for all companies. And we do this also for Allianz, we run different stress tests, as like we run the stress test for the financial crisis, 2018.
