As Jay said, we are very pleased with our First Quarter results, as well as our liquidity and capital positions. Operating cash flows of approximately $530 million was strong, despite higher than normal claim payments that were related to Storm Sandy. We repaid $500 million of debt that matured in March and maintained our strong cash position, ending the quarter with holding company liquidity of just over $1.5 billion. We continue to generate more capital than what is needed to support our businesses, so we returned $476 million of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $176 million, and common share repurchases of $300 million, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. And we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.46 per share to $0.50 per share, an increase of almost 9%. We also recorded on a consolidated basis, pretax net favorable prior year reserve development of $231 million for the quarter, which was lower than the $304 million we reported in the prior year quarter. And each of our segments once again saw its reserves develop favorably. I should point out that this quarter's reserve development included an unusual item of $42 million pretax charge precipitated by legislation in New York related to the New York Fund for Reopened Cases for workers' compensation. Business Insurance accounted for a little less than half of this quarter's total reserve development. Favorable development in BI was driven by better than expected loss experience and general liability for accident years 2003 and prior, as well as accident years 2004 through 2010, resulting from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected, and by property loss development for accident years 2010 through 2012. I should also note that BI reserve development was reduced by the $42 million pretax charge precipitated by the New York legislation concerning workers' comp that I mentioned previously, and excluding the impact of this legislation, our workers' comp reserves were essentially unchanged for all accident years. The rest of this quarter's favorable reserve development primarily resulted from better than expected loss development in bond and financial products contract surety business for accident years 2006, '07, '08, and '10, better than expected loss development in several international businesses within FPII, and better than expected cat and non-cat loss development in Personal Insurance homeowners business for accident year 2011. On a combined statutory basis for all of our US subs, accident years 2003 and prior, as well as accident years 2004 through 2011 all developed favorably in the quarter, while accident year 2012 developed very slightly unfavorably. And finally to update you on Storm Sandy, our current estimate of total ultimate losses is now $1.011 billion net of reinsurance and pretax, down $13 million from our Fourth Quarter 2012 estimate. Finally, all of our capital ratios remained at or better than our target levels at the end of the quarter. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $4.4 billion pretax or $2.9 billion after-tax, a slight decrease from the beginning of the year due to the rise in interest rates that took place during the quarter. And book value per share was $68 or 7% higher than at the end of the prior year quarter, and 1% higher than at the beginning of the year. So with that, let's have Brian talk about the operations.",   Thanks  As  said we are very pleased with our First Quer results as well as our liquidity and capital positions Operating cash flows of approximately $ million was strong despite higher than normal claim payments that were related to Storm Sandy We repaid $ million of debt that matured in h and maintained our strong cash position ending the quer with holding company liquidity of just over $ billion We continue to generate more capital than what is needed to support our es so we returned $ million of excess capital to our sharehols through divids of $ million and common share repurchases of $ million consistent with our ongoing capital   And we announced an increase in our querly divid from $ per share to $ per share an increase of almost % We also recorded on a consolidated basis pretax net favorable prior year reserve development of $ million for the quer which was lower than the $ million we reported in the prior year quer And each of our segments once again saw its reserves develop favorably I should point out that this quer's reserve development included an unusual item of $ million pretax charge precipitated by legislation in New York related to the New York Fund for Reopened Cases for workers' compensation   ed for a little less than half of this quer's total reserve development Favorable development in BI was driven by better than expected loss experience and general liability for accit years  and prior as well as accit years  through  resulting from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected and by property loss development for accit years  through  I should also note that BI reserve development was reduced by the $ million pretax charge precipitated by the New York legislation concerning workers' comp that I mentioned previously and excluding the impact of this legislation our workers' comp reserves were essentially unchanged for all accit years The rest of this quer's favorable reserve development primarily resulted from better than expected loss development in bond and financial products contract surety  for accit years  ' ' and ' better than expected loss development in several international es within FPII and better than expected cat and non-cat loss development in   homeowners  for accit year  On a combined statutory basis for all of our US subs accit years  and prior as well as accit years  through  all developed favorably in the quer while accit year  developed very slightly unfavorably And finally to update you on Storm Sandy our current estimate of total ultimate losses is now $ billion net of re and pretax down $ million from our Fourth Quer  estimate Finally all of our capital ratios remained at or better than our target levels at the end of the quer Net unrealized  gains were approximately $ billion pretax or $ billion after-tax a slight decrease from the beginning of the year due to the rise in interest rates that took place during the quer And book value per share was $ or % higher than at the end of the prior year quer and % higher than at the beginning of the year So with that let's have  talk about the operations,thank result liquidity capital position cash flow claim payment debt cash position quer company liquidity capital es capital sharehol divid share repurchase capital increase divid share share increase % basis pretax net year reserve development quer year quer segment reserve quer reserve development item charge legislation worker compensation ed half quer reserve development development loss experience liability year year environment property loss development year reserve development charge legislation worker comp impact legislation worker comp reserve year rest quer reserve development loss development bond product contract surety year loss development es cat loss development homeowner year basis sub accit year year quer year estimate loss net re estimate capital ratio target level end quer gain pretax tax decrease beginning year rise interest rate place quer book value share % end year quer % beginning year operation,"['liquidity', 'flow', 'payment', 'debt', 'liquidity', 'repurchase', 'pretax', 'net', 'charge', 'legislation', 'worker', 'compensation', 'experience', 'liability', 'charge', 'legislation', 'worker', 'comp', 'legislation', 'worker', 'comp', 'rest', 'bond', 'contract', 'surety', 'cat', 'homeowner', 'accit', 'estimate', 'net', 'estimate', 'gain', 'pretax', 'tax', 'decrease', 'rise', 'place']",120,742,26,6.183333333333334,4.615384615384615,37,0.0032341038,0.003306302,0.004043998,0.0033190735,0.003683029,0.0027859844,0.0011907096,0.0030041144,0.0024281444,0.031000447,0.00272515,0.0019497569,0.0015230074,0.0033989653,0.0014917563,0.000958652,0.00071378367,0.0018021277,0.0020083184,0.0034127224,0.003557813,0.0050849044,0.004699825,0.0010207845,0.0018415044,0.0016092287,0.0015820886,0.9026237,topic_28
449,Craig W. Howie,20170725_Everest_Re_Group_Ltd-_Earnings_Call_2017-7-25_FS000000002361631992.pdf,2017-07-25,71.0,1,0,Everest Re," 17579923  Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings, with net income of $246 million. This compares to net income of $156 million for the second quarter of 2016. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $537 million compared to $327 million for the first half of 2016. The primary differences were an improved underwriting result, higher capital gains, higher investment income, lower catastrophe losses and lower foreign exchange losses compared to the first half of 2016. Net income included $50 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $30 million of capital losses in the first half of 2016. After-tax operating income for the second quarter was $227 million, compared to $134 million in 2016. Operating income, year-todate, was $487 million, compared to $357 million for the first six months of 2016. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $330 million for the first half, compared to an underwriting gain of $234 million in the same period last year. All segments reported underwriting gains for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. The year-to-date combined ratio for the group was 88.3%, down from 90.7% reported in the first half of 2016, with lower catastrophe losses contributing to this favorable variance. In the second quarter of 2017, the group saw $54 million of current year catastrophe losses, net of Reinsurance. Of the total, $25 million related to wildfires in South Africa, $15 million related to U.S. storms in Colorado, and $14 million related to floods in Peru. This compares with $124 million of catastrophes during the second quarter of 2016. On a year-to-date basis, catastrophe losses totaled $74 million, compared to $134 million for the first half of 2016. Excluding the catastrophe losses, the current year attritional combined ratio through the first six months was 85.6%, essentially flat from the 85.7% for the first half of 2016. Our expense ratio remains at 5.8% for the first two quarters of 2017. From investments, pre-tax investment income was $135 million for the quarter and $257 million year-to-date on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was up 9% from one year ago. This result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $40 million for the first half of 2016 primarily due to the turnaround in energy-related investments compared to last year. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9%, with a duration of just over three years. Foreign exchange is reported in other income. For the first half of 2017, foreign exchange losses were $5 million, compared to $31 million of foreign exchange losses in the first six months of 2016. The 2016 foreign exchange losses reflected the weakening of the British pound during 2016 related to the Brexit vote. Other income also included $4 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re in the first six months of 2017, compared to $3 million of income in the first half last year. The increase reflects the lower level of catastrophe losses during the first half of 2017 compared to 2016, resulting in a higher profit share to Everest. On income taxes, similar to the first quarter of 2017, the 9% year-to-date effective tax rate on operating income was lower than the expected range for the year. The 2017 rate is lower than the 10% tax rate for the full year 2016 due to a FASB tax accounting change related to share-based compensation and the utilization of foreign tax credits for years 2008 and prior. These two items reduced the effective tax rate by about 1 point. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. Should catastrophe losses come in lower than this estimate, it would be expected that the tax rate would increase. Stable cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $634 million for the first half of 2017, compared to $684 million in 2016. The decline reflects a higher level of paid catastrophe losses in 2017 compared with 2016. Shareholders equity for the group was $8.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $500 million or 6% over year-end 2016. This is after taking into account capital return for $103 million of dividends paid in the first half of 2017. Our capital position remains very strong and continues to grow. Thank you. And now, John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.",   Thank you  and good morning everyone  had a solid quer of earnings with net income of $ million This compares to net

1024,Jay S. Benet,20180424_TRAVELERS_COS_IN-_Earnings_Call_2018-4-24_FS000000002421134731.pdf,2018-04-24,98.0,1,0,TRAVELERS COS," 2456473  Thanks, Alan. As Alan said, we're pleased that core income was up 10% this quarter, $678 million versus $614 million in the prior-year quarter, which resulted in core ROE of 11.9%. Catastrophe losses were $354 million pre-tax, which was unusually high for the first quarter although comparable to last year's unusually high first quarter. Two significant storms in March accounted for almost 70% of the cat losses cat number 15, an unusual winter windstorm in the Northeast U.S.; and cat number 17, a tornado hailstorm that did considerable damage in the Southeast United States. On a more positive note, net favorable prior-year reserve development, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly, was $150 million pre-tax or $69 million higher than in the prior-year quarter with each of our segments contributing. Our underlying combined ratio remained strong at 92.4%, up only slightly from 91.7% in the prior-year quarter due to normal quarterly variability in both loss activity, mostly from non-cat weather, and expenses. Pre-tax net investment income of $603 million was slightly below the prior-year quarter, but there's an important story underneath. In the past, you've heard me say over and over again that fixed income NII declined due to historically low interest rates. This quarter, pretax fixed income NII of $500 million increased by $12 million compared to the prior-year quarter, the first time we've seen an increase in many years. This was driven by the more favorable interest rate environment, particularly for short-term rates, as well as an increase on our average invested assets due to growing net written premiums in recent periods. If you add in the benefit of the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, fixed income NII on an after-tax basis increased quarter-over-quarter by $36 million. Looking forward to the rest of 2018, we'd expect after-tax fixed income NII to increase by approximately $40 million to $45 million each quarter as compared to the corresponding quarters of 2017. The non-fixed income portfolio continued to perform well, delivering $113 million of pre-tax NII. Within core income, income tax expense was lower than the prioryear quarter by $30 million, driven by a $74 million benefit in the current quarter that resulted from the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate for all the tax-exempt income, partially offset by the inclusion in the prior-year quarter of a $39 million benefit that resulted from successfully closing out our federal income tax exams for 2013 and 2014. As I mentioned, consolidated net favorable prior-year reserve development was $150 million pre-tax this quarter compared to $81 million in the prior-year quarter. Business Insurance's net favorable reserve development was $66 million pre-tax compared to $61 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by better-than-expected loss experience in domestic workers' comp and commercial property, partially offset by higher-thanexpected loss experience in domestic commercial auto. Bond & Specialty's PYD was $35 million pre-tax compared to $14 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by domestic management liability, while PI had net favorable reserve development of $49 million pre-tax compared to $6 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by domestic homeowners and auto. On a combined statutory Schedule P basis, all of our U.S. subsidiaries, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate, developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter, except commercial auto, which developed unfavorably by approximately $50 million pre-tax. Operating cash flows of $554 million remained strong, although lower than first quarter 2017, primarily due to the relatively high level of cat claim payments. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of almost $1.8 billion, and all of our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. The recent run-up in interest rates that's benefiting fixed income NII caused net unrealized investment gains to decrease considerably from $1.1 billion after-tax at year end 2017 to $133 million after-tax at the end of the first quarter, and this decrease in net unrealized investment gains was the driver behind a 3% decrease in book value per share from year end 2017 from $87.46 to $85.03. I'll remind you that changes in net unrealized investment gains or losses do not impact the manner in which we manage our investment portfolio or our business. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little or no impact on regulatory capital. Adjusted book value per share which excludes net unrealized investment gains or losses was $84.54 or 1% higher than the beginning of the year and 4% higher than at the end of last year's first quarter. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses despite the high level of cat losses, allowing us to return almost $600 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. We paid dividends of $197 million and repurchased $401 million of our common shares this quarter, including $350 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program and $51 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and pay out of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.72 per share to $0.77 per share.

1071,Jeremy Noble,20181031_Markel_Corp-_Earnings_Call_2018-10-31_DN000000002486888758.pdf,2018-10-31,48.0,1,0,Markel Corp-," 20687803  Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. Our comprehensive income for the first nine months of 2018 reflects contributions from all three of our engines and demonstrates the value of having diversified operation. Our underwriting operations produced an underwriting profit despite catastrophe losses during the period. Markel Ventures operations continue to make significant contributions to our overall results. With our investment portfolio, 2018 reflects strong performance in our equity portfolio year-to-date while, our fixed income portfolio was unfavorably impacted by rising interest rates. Total operating revenues grew 32% to $5.8 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to a 54% increase in revenues from our Markel Ventures segment, a 12% increase in earned premiums from our underwriting operations, and $408 million of net investment gains for the first nine months of 2018. Starting with our underwriting results. Gross written premiums were $4.5 billion for the first nine months of 2018, compared to $4.1 billion in 2017, an increase of 9%. The increase in gross premium volume was attributable to the contribution of premium from our new collateral protection business, which we acquired in November of last year and a new surety businesses acquired in May of 2017. We also saw organic growth across most lines within our Insurance segment. Year-to-date retention of gross written premiums decreased from 84% in 2017 to 83% in 2018. This decrease was driven by lower retention on our personal lines business within the insurance segment and our property product lines within the Reinsurance segment. Earned premiums increased 12% to $3.5 billion for the first nine months of 2018, due to higher written premiums in our Insurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months of 2018 was a 94% compared to a 108% last year. In 2018 combined ratio included underwriting losses of $76 million net of reinstatement premiums from Hurricane Florence and Typhoon Jebi or two points from a consolidated combined ratio. In 2017 combined ratio included underwriting losses of $503 million, net of reinstatement premiums from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and earthquakes in Mexico were 16 points from the consolidated combined ratio. Excluding the impact of catastrophe losses in both 2018 and 2017, our combined ratio was flat to prior year. Next I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues for Markel Ventures for the first nine months of 2018 increased to $1.4 billion compared to $933 million a year ago. The increased revenues are primarily attributable to Costa Farms, which we acquired in August of 2017, as well as higher sales volume in both our products and services businesses. Operating income for Markel Ventures was $60 million for the first nine months of 2018 compared to $71 million last year. EBITDA was $128 million for the first nine months of 2018 compared to $121 million last year. In 2018, operating income and EBITDA were both impacted by expenses related to an investigation and remediation associated with the manufacture of products at one of our businesses and impairment charge related to intangible assets of this reporting unit. These expenses were partially offset by the contributions of operating income and EBITDA attributable to Costa Farms in 2018. Turning to our investment results. Net investment income increased from $304 million for the first nine months of 2017 to $320 million this year. The increase was driven by short term investment income, primarily due to higher term interest rates. Net investment gains included in net income were $408 million for the first nine months of 2018, compared to net investment losses of just under $2 million in 2017. Net investment gains for 2018, included $417 million of pre-tax gain attributable to the increase in fair value of our equity portfolio. As a reminder, effective of January 1, 2018 all changes in the fair value of equity portfolio are included in net income rather than in other comprehensive income. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $384 million during the first nine months of 2018, reflecting a decrease in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio resulting from rising interest rates. Given our long term focus variability in the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected. Now if we take a look at our total results for the year, our effective tax rate was a 32% in both 2018 and 2017. As previously discussed, the impact of our decision to elect two of our UK subsidiaries as US taxpayers beginning in 2018 added $102 million or 11% to the 2018 effective tax rate. Our estimated annual effective tax rate, which excludes this impact was 20% in 2018, compared to 28% in 2017. The decrease in estimated annual effective tax rate was primarily attributable to decrease in US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the tax reform legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. We reported net income to shareholders of $623 million for the first nine months of 2018, compared to a loss of $40 million a year ago. Comprehensive income to shareholders for the first nine months of 2018 was $305 million compared to $546 million a year ago. Comprehensive income for the period was driven by net income the components of which I just discussed, which is partially offset by the decline in the fair value of fixed maturities since the end of 2017. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $763 million for the first nine months of 2018 compared to $599 million for the same period of 2017. Operating cash flows for 2018 reflected higher net premium collections, lower payments for employee profit sharing and income taxes compared with same period 2017. 2018 also included higher claims payments driven in part by the 2017 catastrophe losses. Invested assets for the holding company was $3.1 billion at the end of September, up from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase in invested assets is primary due to dividends received from certain of our UK subsidiaries. We are well positioned to fund our acquisitions of both Brahmin and Nephila from resources on hand. Total shareholders' equity stood at $9.8 billion at the end of September. And now I'll turn it over to Richie, who will talk more about our underwriting results.",   Thank you  and good morning everyone Our comprehensive income for the first nine months of  reflects

453,Craig William Howie,20190507_Everest_Re_Group_Ltd-_Earnings_Call_2019-5-7_DN000000002633729255.pdf,2019-05-07,95.0,1,0,Everest Re," 17579923  Thank you, Dom. And good morning, everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings with net income of $349 million for the first quarter of 2019, this compares to net income of $210 million for the first quarter of 2018. The 2019 result represents an annualized net income return on equity of 17%. Net income included $74 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $19 million of capital losses in the first quarter last year. The 2019 capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the first quarter was $282 million compared to $220 million in 2018. This represents an annualized operating return on equity of 14%. These results were driven by strong underwriting results across the group, stable investment income and lower catastrophe losses compared to the first quarter last year. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $196 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $108 million in the same period last year. In the first quarter of 2019 Everest saw $25 million of catastrophe losses related to flooding in Australia compared to $100 million of catastrophe losses reported during the first quarter of 2018. Overall, our prior year catastrophe loss estimates continue to hold. We revised the ultimate loss estimates by event and by segment with no change in the overall loss estimates. Estimated net favorable prior year catastrophe development was offset by $24 million of adverse catastrophe development on the third quarter 2018 Japan loss events. No other events reached our $10 million catastrophe threshold in the first quarter of 2019. Therefore any losses arising from these events were covered in our attritional loss estimates, which include a load for estimates less than $10 million. The overall current year attritional combined ratio was 87.4%, up slightly from 87.1% in the first quarter of 2018. The attritional loss ratio remained relatively flat at 59.2% in line with Dom's earlier comments, while the commission ratio of 22.5% was up slightly compared to the same period last year, primarily due to changes in business mix and contingent commission adjustments in the reinsurance segment. The group expense ratio remains low at 5.7% and was lower than prior year due to the increase in earned premium. Our reported combined ratio of 88.7% was lower than first quarter last year, primarily due to the lower reported catastrophe losses in 2019 . For investments, pretax investment income was $141 million for the quarter, this was based on our $19 billion investment portfolio, a new record for Everest. Investment income was 2% above the first quarter of last year. This result was primarily driven by the increase from the investment grade fixed income portfolio, which had a higher asset base this year. This was partially offset by lower limited partnership income and some partnerships report income on a quarter lag, this quarter's results reflected the poor equity market performance of the 2018 fourth quarter. We would expect there to be improvement in the limited partnership income going forward if the public equity market trading conditions continue to improve in 2019. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3% flat compared to one year ago. However, both investment grade and alternative fixed income yields were up year-overyear.On income taxes, the 12.5% effective tax rate on operating income was close to the 13% tax rate we expect for the full year. Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $460 million for the first quarter of 2019, compared to $196 million in 2018. The increase reflects a lower level of paid catastrophe losses in 2019 compared to 2018. Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.4 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $523 million or 7% compared to year-end 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity since yearend 2018 is primarily attributable to $349 million of net income and the sharp recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio, partially offset by capital return from $57 million of dividends paid and $16 million of share buybacks in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we purchased another $9 million of shares after the close of the quarter for a total of $25 million year-to-date. Everest continues to maintain a very strong capital position with low debt leverage and high liquidity in our investment portfolio in addition to our robust cash flow. As Dom mentioned, the strength of our balance sheet is critical to the success of our business and contestation to this is, the affirmation of our AM Best, A+ Superior rating announced last week.

1008,Jay Benet,20131022_TRAVELERS_COS_IN-_Earnings_Call_2013-10-22_SD000000002706810460.pdf,2013-10-22,74.0,1,0,TRAVELERS COS," 2456473  Thank you, Jay. Let me begin by saying that our Third Quarter results, operating income of $2.35 per diluted share, a record level, and operating ROE of 15.2% were very strong, having benefited from solid investment and underwriting performance. Our combined ratio of 88.9% was also very strong, reflecting earned rate increases that exceeded lost cost trends in each of our business segments, relatively low level of both cat and non-cat weather-related losses, and $158 million of net favorable prior-year reserve development, which was net of an increase to our asbestos reserves. This has been the case in recent periods. While the underlying asbestos environment has remained essentially unchanged, payment trends have been moderately higher than what we had expected. For the quarter, excluding the asbestos provision -- which, in a 10-year table, would be included in the prior-to-2004 accident year row -- each accident year developed favorably, and each product line developed favorably or was essentially unchanged. We continue to generate capital in excess of what is needed to support our businesses. And, consistent with our strategy, we have returned a very significant amount of capital to our shareholders. Operating cash flows in excess of $1.6 billion were extremely strong this quarter, bringing total operating cash flows to almost $2.9 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion after returning almost $1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $185 million and common share repurchases of $800 million. Year-to-date, we returned almost $2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $552 million, and common share repurchases of $1.4 billion, leaving us with only $759 million remaining under previous share repurchase authorizations as of the end of the Third Quarter. Since we may exhaust this amount before the end of the year, as announced today, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases. All of our capital ratios remained at or about our better than their target levels. Our debt to total cap ratio of 21.4% was well within its target range, although up slightly in the quarter due to our successfully issuing $500 million of 30-year 4.6% senior debt at the end of July. Book value per share increased 2% and adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, increased 3% during the quarter; while year-to-date, book value per share increased 1% and adjusted book value per share increased 8%. The difference between the unadjusted and adjusted year-to-date growth rates in book value per share was driven by the impact that the recent rise in interest rates had on net unrealized investment gains. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $1.6 billion at the end of the Third Quarter as compared to $3.1 billion at the beginning of the year. So, with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian, who's going to comment further on operating results.",   Thank you  Let me begin by saying that our Third Quer results operating income of $ per diluted share a record level and operating ROE of % were very strong having benefited from solid  and unwriting performance Our combined ratio of % was also very strong reflecting earned rate increases that exceeded lost cost trends in each of our  segments relatively low level of both cat and non-cat weather-related losses and $ million of net favorable prior-year reserve development which was net of an increase to our asbestos reserves This has been the case in recent periods While the unlying asbestos environment has remained essentially unchanged payment trends have been moately higher than what we had expected For the quer excluding the asbestos provision -- which in a -year table would be included in the prior-to- accit year row -- each accit year developed favorably and each product  developed favorably or was essentially unchanged We continue to generate capital in excess of what is needed to support our es And consistent with our  we have returned a very significant amount of capital to our sharehols Operating cash flows in excess of $ billion were extremely strong this quer bringing total operating cash flows to almost $ billion year-to-date We ended the quer with holding company liquidity of approximately $ billion after returning almost $ billion of excess capital to our sharehols through divids of $ million and common share repurchases of $ million Year-to-date we returned almost $ billion of excess capital to our sharehols through divids of $ million and common share repurchases of $ billion leaving us with only $ million remaining un previous share repurchase authorizations as of the end of the Third Quer Since we may exhaust this amount before the end of the year as announced today our  of s authorized an additional $ billion of share repurchases All of our capital ratios remained at or about our better than their target levels Our debt to total cap ratio of % was well within its target range although up slightly in the quer due to our successfully issuing $ million of -year % senior debt at the end of July Book value per share increased % and adjusted book value per share which excludes unrealized  gains and losses increased % during the quer; while year-to-date book value per share increased % and adjusted book value per share increased % The difference between the unadjusted and adjusted year-to-date growth rates in book value per share was driven by the impact that the recent rise in interest rates had on net unrealized  gains Net unrealized  gains were approximately $ billion at the end of the Third Quer as compared to $ billion at the beginning of the year So with that let me turn the mic over to  who's going to comment further on operating results,result income share record level % unwriting performance ratio % rate increase cost trend segment level cat weather loss year reserve development net increase asbestos reserve case period asbestos environment payment trend quer asbestos provision -year table to- year row accit year product capital excess es amount capital sharehol cash flow excess cash flow year date quer company liquidity capital sharehol divid share repurchase date capital sharehol divid share repurchase share repurchase authorization end amount end year today share repurchase capital ratio target level debt cap ratio % target range quer -year % debt end value share % book value share gain loss % quer year date book value share % book value share % difference year date growth rate book value share impact rise interest rate gain gain end beginning year mic operating result,"['record', 'unwriting', 'cat', 'weather', 'net', 'asbestos', 'asbestos', 'payment', 'asbestos', 'provision', 'table', 'row', 'accit', 'excess', 'flow', 'excess', 'flow', 'liquidity', 'repurchase', 'repurchase', 'repurchase', 'authorization', 'repurchase', 'debt', 'cap', 'range', 'debt', 'gain', 'difference', 'rise', 'gain', 'gain', 'mic', 'operating']",106,613,30,5.783018867924528,3.533333333333333,34,0.0032341038,0.003306302,0.03131293,0.0033190735,0.003683029,0.030054916,0.0011907096,0.0030041144,0.0024281444,0.0037315155,0.00272515,0.0019497569,0.0015230074,0.0033989653,0.0014917563,0.000958652,0.00071378367,0.0018021277,0.0020083184,0.0034127224,0.003557813,0.032353833,0.004699825,0.0010207845,0.0018415044,0.0016092287,0.0015820886,0.8480859,topic_28

I'm happy to report the performance for the first half of 2018 was strong. Our underwriting Markel Ventures operations have made substantial contributions to our results during 2018, largely attributable to profitable growth from acquisitions made in 2017. Our investment returns reflects unfavorable market movements on our fixed maturity portfolio due to rising interest rates. However, we continue to maintain a long-term focus with our investment strategy. Total operating revenues grew 23% to approximately $3.6 billion in 2018; the increase was primarily attributable to a 14% increase in earned premium and a 62% increase in revenues for Markel Ventures. The increase in earned premiums and other revenues was partially offset by net investment losses for the first six months of 2018 compared to net investment gains last year. Starting with our underwriting results. Gross written premiums were $3 billion for the first half of 2018 compared to $2.8 billion in 2017, an increase of 7%. The increase in gross premium volumes was attributable to the contribution of premium from our new surety business, which we acquired in May, 2017 and our collateral protection business, which we acquired in November of last year. We also saw organic growth across most lines within our insurance segment. Retention of gross written premiums decreased from 85% in 2017 to 83% in 2018. This decrease was driven by lower retention on our classic car business within the insurance segment and on our Property product line within the Reinsurance segment. Earned premiums increased 14% to $2.3 billion for the first half of 2018 due to higher written premiums in our insurance segment and higher earnings in our Reinsurance segment related to increased premiums volume in 2017. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first six months of 2018 was 91% compared to 95% last year. As I mentioned previously the 2017 combined -- consolidated combined ratio included $85 million or four points of adverse development on prior year loss reserves in our Reinsurance segment resulting from the decrease in the Ogden Rate which is used to calculate some awards on U.K. bottling injury cases. Now let's talk about the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures for the first six months of 2018 increased to $971 million compared to $601 million a year ago. The increased revenues are primarily attributable to the third quarter 2017 acquisition of Costa Farms as well as higher revenues in both our products and services businesses. Operating income for Markel Ventures were $37 million for the first half of 2018 compared to $64 million last year. EBITDA was $82 million for the first half of 2018 compared to $97 million last year. The decrease in both operating income and EBITDA was primarily due to expenses related to an investigation and remediation associated with the manufacture of products at one of our businesses and to an impairment charge related to intangible assets of this reporting unit. These expenses were partially offset by the contribution of operating income and EBITDA attributable to Costa Farms in 2018. Now taking a look at our investment results. Investment income increased from $200 million for the first half of 2017 to $213 million this year. The increase was driven by short term investment income primarily due to higher short term interest rates and higher dividend income due to increased equity holding and dividend rate compared to the same period of 2017. Net investment losses included in net income were $18 million for the first half of 2018 compared to net investment gains of $38 million in 2017. Net investment losses for 2018 include $9 million of pretax losses attributable to the decline in the fair value of our equity portfolio. As we discussed last quarter effective January 1 2018 all changes in fair value of the equity portfolio are included in net income rather than other comprehensive income. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $282 million during the first half of 2018 reflecting a decrease in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio. Given our long term focus variability in the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected. Taking a look at our total results for the year. Our effective tax rate was 47% in 2018 compared to 27% a year ago. As I mentioned last quarter the impact of management's decision to elect the two U.K. subsidiaries as U.S. taxpayers beginning in 2018 added $102 million or 25% to the effective tax rate. Our estimated annual effective tax rate which excludes this impact as well as certain other items that are infrequent or unusual in nature were 20% in 2018 compared to 27% in 2017. The decrease in the estimated annual effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the decrease in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of Tax Reform Legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. We reported net income to shareholders of $214 million for the first half of 2018, compared to $220 million a year ago. Comprehensive loss to shareholders for the period was $11 million compared to comprehensive income to shareholders of $566 million a year ago. The comprehensive loss for the period was driven by the decline in the fair value of fixed maturities since the end of 2017, which was largely offset by net income for the period. Book value per share was $683 at the end of June 2018 compared to $684 at the end of 2017. I think we can call that flattish. Finally, I'll make a couple of comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $308 million for the first half of 2018 compared to $238 million for the same period of 2017. Operating cash flows for 2018 reflected higher premium collections, higher cash flows from Markel Ventures and lower payments for employee profit sharing compared to the same period of 2017. 2018 also included higher claim payment, largely driven by the 2017 capacity losses. As of June 30, 2018 we have paid 61% of our total estimated losses on the 2017 catastrophe. Invested assets at the holding company were $2.4 billion at June 30, 2018 and $2.7 billion at the end of the year 2017. The decrease in invested assets is primarily due to an increase in loans and capital contributions to our subsidiaries and interest payments associated with our unsecured senior notes.

I plan to follow the same format as in prior quarters. I'll start by discussing our underwriting operations, followed by a brief discussion of our investment results and bring the two together with a discussion of our total results. I'm pleased to say that for 2012, we are off to a good, solid start. Our total operating revenues grew 18%, to $733 million in 2012, up from $622 million in 2011. The increase is due to a 15% increase in revenue from our insurance operations, and a 43% increase in revenue from non-insurance operations, which we refer to as Markel Ventures. Moving into the underwriting results, First Quarter 2012 gross written premiums were just under $650 million, which is an increase of 10% compared to 2011. The increase in 2012 was due to higher gross premium buy-ins in each of our three operating segments. Net written premiums were approximately $580 million, up 12% to the prior year. Retentions were up slightly in 2012 at 90%, compared to 88% in 2011. Earned premiums increased 14%. This increase was driven by a 23% increase in earned premium from the London Insurance Market segment. First quarter 2011 net written and net earned premiums for this segment were reduced by approximately $9 million of reinsurance cost, associated with losses incurred during the First Quarter a year ago. Our combined ratio was 100% for 2012, compared to 112% in 2011. The combined ratio for 2012 includes $20 million, or four points of expense, related to our prospective adoption of the new DAC accounting standard. The 2011 combined ratio included 15 points of underwriting losses related to the three catastrophe events which occurred last year in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Excluding the impact of the prospective adoption of the new DAC accounting standards in the First Quarter of 2012, and the effects of the catastrophes in the First Quarter of 2011, our combined ratio improved by one point. This improvement was due to a lower expense ratio, and a lower current accident year loss ratio, partially offset by less favorable development of prior year's loss reserve. The improvement in the expense ratio is primarily due to an increase in earned premium. The improvement in the current accident year loss ratio was due to lower attritional current year losses in the Excess and Surplus Lines segment, and to lower attritional and large energy losses in the London Insurance Market. Favorable redundancies on prior year's loss reserves decreased to $64 million, or 12 points of favorable development, compared to $75 million, or 16 points of favorable development in 2011. The decrease is primarily due to less favorable development of prior year's losses in the Excess and Surplus Lines segment. In the First Quarter of 2011, we resolved a significant portion of our outstanding liabilities associated with an Arizona missions program for mortgage servicing companies and as a result, reduced loss reserves by $16 million. Next I'll discuss the results of our non-insurance operations, which we call Markel Ventures. In 2012, revenues from our non-insurance operations were $97 million, compared to $68 million in 2011. Net income to shareholders from our non-insurance operations was $200,000 in 2012, compared to $2.4 million in 2011. Revenues from our non-insurance operations increased in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to our acquisitions of Baking Technology Systems, Incorporated, and WI Holdings, Incorporated in late 2011. The decrease in net income to shareholders from our non-insurance operation is a result of decreased shipments for the quarter in our manufacturing operations, where we expect to see improvements as the year progresses. Turning now to our investment results. Investment income was up 14% in 2012 to just under $80 million. Net investment income included a favorable change in the fair value of our credit default swap of $11 million. During the First Quarter of 2012, financial markets improved and credit spreads narrowed, which favorably impacted the CDS ph. Net realized investment gains were $12 million, compared to $11 million in 2011. There were no other-than-temporary impairments in either period. Unrealized gains increased $214 million before taxes in 2012, driven by increases in equity securities. Tom will go into further details on investments in his comments. Looking at our total results for 2012, the effective tax rate was 23% in 2012, compared to an effective tax rate of 14% in 2011. The increase is primarily due to anticipating a smaller tax benefit related to tax exempt investment income, as a result of projecting higher pretaxed income for 2012 than in 2011. We reported net income to shareholders of $57 million, compared $8 million in 2011. Book value per share increased 6% to $373 per share at March 31, 2012, up from $352 per share at year end. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Net cash used by operating activities was approximately $64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to net cash used by operating activities of approximately $9 million for the same period of 2011. The increase in net cash used by operating activities was due to increased claims settlement activity, primarily in the London Insurance Market segment. Historically, First Quarter is our lowest cash generating quarter, as we pay employee benefits, agent incentives, pension contributions and other items of that sort in the First Quarter. We would expect cash from operations to improve in the Second Quarter. Investments in cash held at the holding company were approximately $1 billion at March 31st, as compared to a little less than $1.2 billion at the end of the year 2011. The decrease is due in part to the purchase of THOMCO in January 2012. Mike will discuss that acquisition further in his comments. At this point, I will turn it over to Mike.",   Thank you  Good morning everyone I plan to follow the same format as in prior quers I'll st by discussing our unwriting operations followed by a brief

186,Anne G. Waleski,20160803_Markel_Corp-_Earnings_Call_2016-8-3_FS000000002295888288.pdf,2016-08-03,45.0,1,0,Markel Corp-," 16735457  Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Like Tom, I'm happy to report that our financial performance for the first half of 2016 continues to be strong across our underwriting, investment and Markel Ventures operations. Given the continued soft market conditions we are pleased with our underwriting results, which had minimal impact from a number of industry-wide catastrophe and large loss events in the second quarter of the year. Our total operating revenues grew 6% to approximately $2.8 billion in 2016 from $2.6 million in 2015. The increase is driven by a roughly 20% increase in revenue from Markel Ventures, which is primarily due to our acquisition of CapTech in the fourth quarter 2015 and higher sales volume in our manufacturing operations. Moving into the underwriting results; gross premium volume for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased 6% compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in gross premium volume was attributable to the reinsurance and U.S. insurance segment, partially offset by lower gross premium volume in our international insurance segment. The increase in the reinsurance segment was due to new business and to the favorable timing of renewals of multiyear policies in our mortgage and general liability lines in 2016. As we discussed in the first quarter call, the increased volume in the U.S. insurance segment is due in part to closing our underwriting systems one week later in 2016 as compared to the same period a year ago. Excluding the impact of this timing difference, we experienced growth in our personal lines business as well as our general liability and property product line. Foreign currency movements did not have a material impact on premiums in 2016. Market conditions remained very competitive. Consistent with our historical practices, we will not write business, when we believe prevailing market rates will not support our underwriting profit targets. Net written premiums for the first six months of 2016 were $2.2 billion, up 8% for the prior year for the same reasons I just discussed. Net retention increased two points to 84% in 2016 compared to 82% in 2015. The increase is due to higher retentions in our reinsurance segment, primarily due to changes in mix of business. Earned premiums were flat for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first six months of 2016 was flat at 90% compared to last year. Lower current accident year losses were offset by less favorable development on prior year loss reserves compared to last year. The current accident year loss ratio included $25 million of underwriting loss, approximately one point on the consolidated combined ratio related to the Canadian wildfires that occurred in the quarter of 2016. This impact was more than offset by lower attritional losses in our International Insurance and Reinsurance segments in 2016, compared to 2015, and lower loss ratios across a number of products in all three of our underwriting segments. For the first six months of 2016 prior year redundancies were $258 million, compared to $296 million for the same period a year ago. As you may recall redundancies on prior year loss reserves in the first half of 2015 included $36 million, or two points attributable to a decrease in the estimated volatility of our consolidated net reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as a result of ceding a significant portion of our asbestos and environmental exposures to a third party in the first quarter of last year. In our U.S. Insurance segment, prior year redundancies for 2016 were $105 million compared to $136 million a year ago. Last year's results included $19 million of redundancies related to the decrease in reserve volatility that I just mentioned. In 2016, we experienced a more favorable – we experienced more favorable development on our general liability and workers' comp product lines compared to a year ago, which was partially offset by adverse development on our specified medical and medical malpractice product lines. In response, we've taken corrective actions for business written in those books. In our International Insurance segment, favorable development on prior year reserves was $69 million, down from $120 million last year. Last year's results included $17 million of redundancies related to the decrease in reserve volatility. Additionally, redundancies on our marine and energy product lines were lower in 2016 compared to 2015. In our Reinsurance segment, we've recognized $71 million of prior year redundancies in 2016, compared to $42 million a year ago. More favorable development on prior year reserves in 2016 was across various product lines, but the most significant year-over-year improvements were seen in our property and workers' comp product lines. Now I'll talk a little bit about Markel Ventures. Revenues from Markel Ventures for the first six months of 2016 increased to $584 million, compared to $485 million a year ago. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to our December 2015 acquisition of CapTech and higher revenues within our manufacturing operations due in part to higher sales volume this year. We also saw increases in Markel Ventures' net income to shareholders and EBITDA for the first six months of 2015, primarily due to expenses recognized in 2015 associated with contingent consideration related to the acquisition of the Cottrell. Net income to shareholders and EBITDA also benefited from continued strong demand for equipment manufacture to support transportation related industries and the acquisition of CapTech in late 2015. Turning to our investment results, investment income increased slightly from $183 million for the first six months of 2015 to $186 million this year. Net realized investment gains for the first six months of 2016 were $38 million compared to $12 million a year ago. Given our long-term focus, variability in the timing of realized and unrealized gains and losses is to be expected. Looking at our total results for the year, our effective tax rate was 26% in the first half of 2016 compared to 16% a year ago. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 was driven by a decrease in foreign tax credits for foreign taxes paid, partially offset by an increase in the estimated earnings from foreign operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates in 2016 as compared to 2015. As you may recall, in 2015, we recognized nonrecurring foreign tax credits of approximately 12% of pre-tax income. Foreign tax credits of the magnitude recognized in 2015 are not expected in future periods. We reported net income to shareholders of $239 million in the first half of 2016 compared to $282 million a year ago. Comprehensive income for the period was $607 million compared to $149 million a year ago. And as a result, book value per share at the end of June 2016 was $603, an increase of 7% since the end of 2015. Finally, I will make a couple of comments on cash flows and the balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $70 million for the first six months of 2016 compared to $238 million for the same period of 2015. Operating cash flows for 2016 included higher claims payments, primarily in the U.S. insurance segment and higher payments for employee profit sharing and income taxes compared to the same period of 2015. Operating cash flows for both 2016 and 2015 were impacted by cash payments made to transfer our contractual obligations under insurance contracts to third-parties. In the second quarter, we issued $500 million of unsecured senior notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem just under $180 million of our other outstanding debt. This resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $44 million. Replacing this debt with our new 30-year 5% note extended the average term of our senior notes at a more favorable interest rate. Our holding company has $1.8 billion of invested assets at June 30, 2016, as compared to $1.6 million a year end. The increase in invested assets is primarily the result of net proceeds from the issuance – the net issuance of long-term debt during the second quarter of 2016. With that, I will turn it over to Mike to talk about our U.S. Insurance segment.",   Thank you  and good morning everyone Like  I'm happy to report that our financial performance for the first half of

Everest had a terrific end to 2015 with one of our strongest quarters in history, helped by reserve releases that impacted both current and prior years. For the fourth quarter of 2015, operating income was $353 million or $8.17 per diluted common share. This compares to operating income of $331 million or $7.28 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The 2015 quarterly result represents an annualized operating return on equity of 19%. For the year, operating income was $1.1 billion or $25.04 per share compared to $1.1 billion or $24.71 per share in 2014. Net income for the year was $978 million or $22.10 per share compared to $1.2 billion or $25.91 per share in 2014. Net income included $130 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $55 million of capital gains last year, or a difference of over $4 per share year-over-year. The 2015 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio and impairments on the fixed income portfolio. The impairment is mainly related to credit write-downs on energy investments. The results reflect a slight increase in the overall current year attritional combined ratio of 82.9%, up from 82% last year. This attritional measure increase of less than one point includes higher than expected current year losses in the reinsurance segments, including $60 million of estimated losses for Tianjin and numerous weather-related losses that did not meet our $10 million catastrophe threshold. In the fourth quarter, Everest saw $20 million of current year catastrophe losses related to the U.S. storms that occurred during the last week of the year. The fourth quarter of 2015 also included favorable development on prior cat losses, largely from the 2013 year. Therefore, net catastrophe losses for the quarter were negative $4 million. Catastrophe losses for the year were $66 million in 2015 compared to $62 million in 2014. For 2015, gross catastrophe losses were $100 million, but were offset by $33 million of favorable development on prior year cat losses, primarily from the 2013 German hailstorms, European floods, Typhoon Fitow, and U.S. storm events. Our reported combined ratio was 83.4% for the year 2015 compared to 82.8% in 2014. The 2015 commission ratio of 21.9% was slightly down from 22% in 2014. Our expense ratio remains low at 4.9% for the year compared to 4.6% in 2014. The expense ratio for the reinsurance segments remained flat at 2.9%, while the overall expense ratio was influenced by the build out of our insurance platform. Everest has one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry. This is a strategic competitive advantage for Everest. On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserves studies. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked prior year development in the insurance segment and for asbestos, which was more than offset by favorable development in the reinsurance segments. The $121 million of prior year reserve development in the insurance segment during the quarter, as referenced by Dom, was largely related to umbrella business and construction liability. These run-off programs were discontinued by the company several years ago. The $155 million of favorable prior year development in the reinsurance segments including Mt. Logan Re reflected $193 million of favorable development offset by a $38 million increase in asbestos reserves related to several large settlements during the year. The $193 million of reinsurance favorable development during the quarter mostly related to casualty and property treaty business both in the United States and internationally. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don't react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $11 million for the quarter and $474 million for the year on our $17.7 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was below last year as anticipated. This result was primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and by the decline in limited partnership income. On the fixed income portfolio, income was down $30 million year-over-year. Limited partnership income was down $26 million year-over-year, primarily due to energy-related investments. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.8% compared to 3.2% in 2014, and duration remained at three years. Other income and expense included $61 million of foreign exchange gains for the 2015 year compared to $30 million of foreign exchange gains in 2014. The foreign exchange gains resulted from the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the other world currencies. On income taxes, the 2015 operating income effective tax rate was 14.5%. This effective tax rate for the year was in line with our expectations for the year. Operating income does not include capital gains or losses. Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $1.3 billion for the year, essentially flat, compared to 2014. This was primarily due to our continued premium growth. Shareholders' equity for the group was $7.6 billion at the end of 2015, up $157 million compared to year-end 2014. This is after taking into account capital returned through $400 million of share buybacks and $175 million of dividends paid in 2015. The company announced a 21% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.15 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our strong capital balance positions us well to continue share repurchases.
