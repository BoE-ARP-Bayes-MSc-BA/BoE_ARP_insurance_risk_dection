These applications are being rebuilt into the cloud to provide superior user experience. And as an example for this the new offering solutions for motor and private customers are scheduled to go live just now at the end of June. Our second focus areas analytics as most of our strategic goals heavily depend on better utilization of data consequently, we've already started to invest in a new analytics platform that brings along state of the art analytics and AI tools and it is built in a way it helps us to deliver data more quickly to the analyst and deploy new inside easily back into our processes this new platform has proven itself in a large number of use cases already in the areas of analytics churn value customer value models and others. For the new strategy, we've now started to rebuild our data warehouse landscape into a cloud native data management solution. Which will help greatly with data integrity and data quality together with the analytics platform both will Portugal leads in a much better position to utilize data as required by our strategy thirdly, and to make it all work as a whole, we put a lot of emphasis on integration for example, we have already deployed modern data streaming technologies two technically decouple our applications, while still being able integrate our processes seamlessly across main for the new strategy, we will now extend these integration solutions to stretch beyond the borders of the enterprise.

The tooling of the P&C business has been a critical factor over the past 6, seven years and which has led to this overview, which I'm going to take you through briefly, which I think is a key differentiator. And we believe no one has that kind of platform. The first point I would make is the various tools are, for most of them if not all of them, in-house-built tools. So we have invested significant amount of money on each of these individual modules, whether they are the single-risk underwriting platform, ForeWriter, which we have presented in one of these instances before; whether it is the new MGA Alpha tool, which has been operating now for over a year. All of them have been the focus of heavy investments. And what we view as core, as strategic, has be done -- has to be done in-house. On the Cat platform, which, again, we have presented to you in the past, we have founded initially with RMS, we've partnered with a broader range of stakeholders. But as we go, we very much internalized those 2. So I think what is very important here is that we're building state-of-the-art, extremely technical models and way before big data and AI were fashionable. The second point is how those modules interact in a platform in a flexible way. It's very important in those technology developments to have a very clear idea as to what is the backbone, what is the central system and what are, if you wish, the APIs, what are the modules that go around it. And having this very clear idea of what should be our IT architecture is quite a differentiator as well. And by combining the state-of-the-art modules individually with a flexible nimble platform are 2 key points. My last comments will be the way we run this. I mean, this is -- this looks good. This is huge investment from an IT point of view, from a technology point of view and mindset and culture. How does that translate in day to day? And that's why, again, when I speak to my competitors, when I speak to some clients, I realize that actually no one has this ability in the running of the business during the renewals period to monitor the performance, the exposures on a daily basis. So I can tell you, when we go through renewals seasons and we meet every day as a management team, we can at very much fingertip get exposures by barrels day to day, the performance, whether we stand on the renewals. And have a consistent view of the overall business performance. And that goes, of course, beyond the renewal's time and with all the exposure management and so on. And this technology is core in the way we operate and the way we steer the business and the portfolios as we underwrite the business.",   Thank you e to the portfolio development is the tooling The tooling of the P&C  has been a critical factor over the past  seven years and which has led to this overview which I'm going to take you through briefly which I think is a key differentiator And we beve no one has that kind of platform The first point I would make is the various tools are for most of them if not all of them in-house-built tools So we have invested significant amount of money on each of these individual modules whether they are the single- unwriting platform ForeWriter which we have presented in one of these instances before; whether it is the new MGA Alpha tool which has been operating now for over a year All of them have been the focus of heavy s And what we view as core as strategic has be done -- has to be done in-house On the Cat platform which again we have presented to you in the past we have founded initially with RMS we've pnered with a broa range of stakehols But as we go we very much internalized those  So I think what is very important here is that we're building state-of-the- extremely technical mos and way before big data and AI were fashionable The second point is how those modules interact in a platform in a flexible way It's very important in those technology developments to have a very clear idea as to what is the backbone what is the central system and what are if you wish the APIs what are the modules that go around it And having this very clear idea of what should be our IT architecture is quite a differentiator as well And by combining the state-of-the- modules individually with a flexible nimble platform are  key points My last comments will be the way we run this I mean this is -- this looks good This is huge  from an IT point of view from a technology point of view and mindset and culture How does that translate in day to day?

Well basically where you're fully right is, most of the components we are developing and using are externally available, standard software programs that we use and that implement. When I look what is the differentiator, it's, at the end, how you implement and how use the technology. There are huge differences. You can have 2 implementations of software, used in a different way, can bring dramatic, different results. Then you mentioned the 2000 bubble. And yes, it was a big one, where I think for me, when I look at it, I believe it is fundamentally different, because the technology is further developed. So the ideas. And many of the things that we are discussing right now are basically the same. But the technology is on a different level. Being it, how far the cloud has developed, the computing power, there were visions that were already in 2000 there. And I sometimes have also the dÃ©jÃ vu. I have similar discussions. But at that point of time, it was very difficult to implement them. And make them really happen. While now we see that it's really taking off. And for most of the use cases, you will find a company that is actually doing it, in the technology space. And that's what it is. So to say, our task, to bring that into our company, into our culture. And make that happen here. That's why, besides knowing the technology, making it accessible, which is possible, we have to have the right culture of implementation. You've heard in all the presentations that this is actually what we are working on, to make that happen in any way. So that's why, even though other companies could access the same technology, it's really about implementing and making it happen. And that is easy said, very difficult to do. It's not an easy task.",   Yes I would kick it off Well basically where you're fully right is most of the coments we are developing and using are externally available standard software programs that we use and that implement When I look what is the differentiator it's at the end how you implement and how use the technology There are huge differences You can have  implementations of software used in a different way can bring dramatic different results Then you mentioned the  bubble And yes it was a big one where I think for me when I look at it I beve it is fundamentally different because the technology is further developed So the ideas And many of the things that we are discussing right now are basically the same But the technology is on a different level Being it how far the cloud has developed the computing power there were visions that were already in  there And I sometimes have also the dÃ©jÃ vu I have similar discussions But at that point of time it was very difficult to implement them And make them really happen While now we see that it's really taking off And for most of the use cases you will find a company that is actually doing it in the technology space And that's what it is So to say our task to bring that into our company into our culture And make that happen here That's why besides knowing the technology making it accessible which is possible we have to have the right culture of implementation You've heard in all the presentations that this is actually what we are working on to make that happen in any way So that's why even though other companies could access the same technology it's really about implementing and making it happen And that is easy said very difficult to do It's not an easy task,coment software program differentiator end technology difference implementation software way result bubble one technology idea thing technology level cloud computing power vision dã © vu discussion point time use case company technology space task company culture technology culture implementation presentation way company technology task,"['coment', 'software', 'differentiator', 'technology', 'implementation', 'software', 'bubble', 'technology', 'technology', 'cloud', 'computing', 'power', 'vision', 'dã', 'technology', 'task', 'culture', 'technology', 'culture', 'implementation', 'technology', 'task']",37,277,26,7.486486486486487,1.4230769230769231,22,0.0027009118,0.0038210964,0.00784345,0.004811448,0.001770004,0.0026778153,0.00400668,0.0040366016,0.0041836686,0.0056834193,0.7329868,0.005377611,0.0047939746,0.16480708,0.0058486904,0.0028991993,0.0039389688,0.0066763014,0.0047350232,0.0021004877,0.0044802153,0.003316425,0.00049600477,0.0037488446,0.0030671312,0.0038838843,0.0053082383,topic_11

The two things I wanted you to, I said in my comments, but sometimes the comments get overlooked and not really listened, attentive to, but it's really an innovation and disruptor.

So, clearly in the future that technology and data analytics and innovation capabilities is something that, we'll be – we've just enhanced dramatically.
