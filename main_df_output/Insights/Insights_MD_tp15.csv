I want to give you an overview of our UK Insurance. On motor (1235) about the loss ratio and the overall result and Lorna is going to cover speciﬁcally claims inﬂation. So, I will talk brieﬂy about changes in prices. On the household, I want to talk about the market, because we had gone through a year of a change and also our result. And I want to answer the question of why are we growing when other competitors are not growing. And ﬁnally, I want to talk about our new product which is van. So, when we look at changes in the motor market in terms of prices, we all know that since March, (1309) Ogden rate, there has been continuous price increases in competitors. However, our strategy was quite diﬀerent, because in mid December last year, when it became obvious that there was going to be a change, we increased our prices signiﬁcantly. That meant, as you can see on the graph on the right, that our Times Top decreased and also did our sales. We were surprised to see that competitors didn't follow and we, for the ﬁrst two months of the year, we were selling less than expected. Now since March, competitors have been Company Name Admiral Group PLC putting prices up, and we also continue doing so. Let's look at the household markets. What we have seen in terms of prices is that for a number years, it has been quite stable. I think this is partly due to the fact that we have enjoyed fairly benign weather. Now, this is changing and we're seeing clear signs of prices going up in the ﬁrst half of this year. We think that behind this is the Floodre level, which put pressure on expense ratio and also, claims inﬂation especially in escape of water (1412). So, what have we done in Admiral? Well, we put prices up in Admiral already in Q4 of last year as a reﬂection of the claims inﬂation that we were also experiencing. What we saw is that since around February this year, prices in the market started to go up. And that meant, again, you can see, that our Times Top increased and that meant that also, our sales did so. Now, since then, we have continued putting prices up. So, overall, what we've seen is in the past nine months, we have put prices up by about high single digits, and we have been able to grow because prices in the market have continued to increase. But, I think, it's also interesting to talk about the sources of growth. On the graph, you can see a very strong growth trajectory. We grew 43% year-on-year. But there are three key sources of where we get this growth. First, the growth of the Price Comparison market that continues to grow in this period and we're a leading player. So, when it grows, the Price Comparison market, we're also able to grow ourselves. Secondly, the growth of our direct sales. When we say direct sales, we mean sales that we acquired through direct marketing so, not Price Comparison. But it also means cross-sells, that is selling to our own motor customer book. And ﬁnally, another important source of growth for the household book is the strong retention. In terms of the results, we were quite pleased to see that both the expense ratio and the loss ratio improved in this period. Particularly signiﬁcant is the outperformance of the expense ratio versus the market. So overall, with the growth and the progress we have made, we have seen proﬁts increasing in the ﬁrst half to £1.6 million. And then let's talk about van and the launch that we did in May this year. And it's interesting because I talk about this new product, but truly this is not new to us. We have had a broker in the van business since 1998 called Gladiator. So, what we did this year is that we changed the model, from being a broker to being an underwriter and that started in May as I mentioned. So, by the time that we ﬁnished the broker, we had about 10% of the market and we have 175,000 vehicles covered. So, now that we have become an underwriter, the focus is for this 12 month is migrating that group of business from the broker to the underwriter. So, you should expect a similar level of the size of the book at the end of the year. We are going to focus on learning about the markets, learning more about the claims experience and about pricing and for the future, we expect to achieve similar results to motor, especially on the expense ratio. Company Name Admiral Group PLC Now before I ﬁnish, I want to talk about the customers, because delivering great service is at the core of the Admiral culture. And therefore, I was disappointed that we sent inaccurate information for our customers, during April and May on our renewal letter. Now all the letters that are issued today have correct information. But I think it's also important that we focus again about this great service that we try to give to our customers. And I thought I talk to you about two examples on how we try to constantly reduce the level of complaints. You can see at the top, there is a graph that shows the results of the complaints referred to the Ombudsman, and we can see that these results are better for Admiral than the average of the market. On the bottom, you can see a graph on the claims complaint that we have versus new claims, and you can see that period after period, we're constantly increasing or improving this level from a very good level. And ﬁnally, we are proud to have won the Best UK Car Insurance Provider for four years in a row. Now, I'm going to hand you Lorna to talk more about claims inﬂation.",   Good morning everybody I want to give you an overview of our UK  On motor  about the loss ratio and the overall result and  is going to cover speciﬁcally claims inﬂation So I will talk brieﬂy about changes in pes On the household I want to talk about the market because we had gone through a year of a change and also our result And I want to answer the question of why are we growing when other competitors are not growing And ﬁnally I want to talk about our new product which is  So when we look at changes in the motor market in terms of pes we all know that since h  Og rate there has been continuous pe increases in competitors However our  was quite diﬀerent because in mid December last year when it became obvious that there was going to be a change we increased our pes signiﬁcantly That meant as you can see on the graph on the right that our es Top decreased and also did our sales We were surprised to see that competitors didn't follow and we for the ﬁrst two months of the year we were selling less than expected Now since h competitors have been  Name Admiral  PLC putting pes up and we also continue doing so Let's look at the household markets What we have seen in terms of pes is that for a number years it has been quite stable I think this is ply due to the fact that we have enjoyed fairly benign weather Now this is changing and we're seeing clear signs of pes going up in the ﬁrst half of this year We think that behind this is the Floodre level which put pressure on expense ratio and also claims inﬂation especially in escape of water  So what have we done in Admiral?

I'm going to talk brieﬂy through the group results, then go on to the UK Insurance proﬁts, and then talk about capital and the interim dividend. But ﬁrst up, let's look at the group proﬁt. This is our usual chart that shows the contributions to the overall result that come from the diﬀerent parts of the group. As David mentioned, the ﬁrst half proﬁt is £195 million, that's modestly higher than H1 of 2016. That includes an improved result in the international insurance. Losses down to £10 million from £13 million. That's in the green. And notably, that includes a much lower loss in our U.S. Insurance operation. H1 also saw an improved Price Comparison result. That's in the light blue. You'll have to trust me on that. You can't see that at all. Again, improved numbers there from the U.S. operations being the key reason for that change. So, these positive moves were oﬀset by higher group or central expenses, which is in the yellow. As you can see from the text on the side, that number includes the debt interest, share scheme charges, and business development costs. And the key reasons for our higher number this year, higher share scheme charges, higher head count, but also higher costs in business development, notably from Admiral Loans. Not forgetting, of course, the UK that's in the sort of dark blue. And as you can see, the UK Insurance proﬁt was broadly ﬂat this year compared to last half year. And the combination of all those factors gets you to a slightly higher H1 result compared to H1 2016. So I'm going to take a few minutes now to talk about the UK Insurance proﬁt. On the top of the slide we show the UK Insurance proﬁt which now covers private car, household and Company Name Admiral Group PLC van over the past three half year periods. On the bottom, you can see the breakdown of the UK Car Insurance combined ratio, which is obviously critical to the proﬁtability. Cristina is going to cover households shortly, but as you can see, that business made another proﬁt in H1, slightly above 2016 despite adding more than 40% to the customer base and we continue to be conservative in booking loss ratios on the household business. Our car insurance at the H1 proﬁt was basically in line with last year so, that's explain what's going on there. So, you can see that one or two things in the text distort the 2016 results we ﬂagged last year and that includes the commutation. And as we said back in March, we will have some residual hangover of the Ogden impact this year and for the next few years or ﬁnancial years. The impact to this half year is approximately £10 million. That's enough to pull the higher current year loss ratio and lower proﬁt commission. And probably the key factor is a lower reserve release this half year versus last half year. As you can see, 21% of premium is still substantial in relative terms that has that percentage being more in line with 2016 and 2015, then obviously we'd have seen an increased UK Car Insurance proﬁt. So, why wasn't it quite as high? Understanding the development of the projected ultimate loss ratios over the past few periods is part of that answer. So, let's take a look at that. This chart should be at least half familiar to you. It's the projection of the ultimate loss ratios by accident years. And this chart shows the position at the end of 2015 and obviously the bracket show the change in those projected ultimates compared to six months prior. What we tend to see over time is improvements in these initially quarters projections at the level of uncertainty over the outcome growth. So, for example, on this chart, you see 2012 accident year improving by 3 percentage points in six months. If we roll that on six months to the middle of 2016, we again see some pretty material improvements to some of the years. Then we come to the end of 2016 and actually here the position is largely stable, one or two small improvements. And don't forget that's inspite of the new Ogden discount rates, minus 0.75% being reﬂected in these projected ultimates. Roll on again to the middle of 2017, the current period and after updating all our case reserves for the impact of Ogden and seeing that going through, pleasing to see generally stable outcomes in the projected ultimates, small improvement on 2015. And here we've added, in the red line, the end of an era and maybe the last time we'll see on a comparable basis Admiral against the market and institution of the graph. As you can see the assessment of the ultimate cost of the minus 0.75% Ogden rate remains unchanged, and obviously these projections continue to reﬂect that route. It is appropriate to say that there's prudence in these projections, and particularly in the most recent years. At this point, we don't give a current year number as you know, but certainly on an underwriting year basis, at least, I would expect that 2017 will be better than 2016 on an ultimate basis. Company Name Admiral Group PLC As we've said in the past, the size of Admiral's reserve releases is driven by two factors. Firstly, the release of the initial margin built against those ﬁrst projections. But also from the improvement we see in the projected ultimates over time. What we've seen in H1 is stability in those projected ultimates. But in light of Ogden, I think it's pretty positive. That stability leads to a lower albeit still substantial reserve release in H1. That's 21% of premiums. Let's take a look at the releases in a bit more detail. As usual, top chart shows the release percentage, shows the premiums focusing on the release on the original Admiral net share of the reserves over the past ﬁve half-year periods, and a couple of observations on the numbers. Firstly, the ﬁrst half of 2015 and 2016 beneﬁted from the improvements in the projected ultimates that we talked about earlier. And so, very large reserve releases of 29% of premiums. The second half of 2016 next, was obviously heavily impacted by Ogden, basically no release at all. And ﬁnally in the ﬁrst half of this year, this 21% is well above the long-term average, which is somewhere around 15%, but it's lower 21% compared to H1 2015 and 2016. As is always the case, there continues to be a prudent and signiﬁcant margin above the projected ultimates in the booked reserves. And, as we usually say, we would expect to continue signiﬁcant reserve releases if the claims develop as we expect them to. Just to ﬁnish the story on releases, this bottom chart splits the total release into the elements on Admiral's original net share of the reserves which is in the dark blue on the bottom. The top, the light blue shows the release that comes from the portion of the reserve that was originally reinsured in the quota share contracts. And just to remind you that 2016 as you can see was impacted by the commutation of 2014, which adversely impacted that number. There've been no impact, no repeat of that impact this year. No commutation in the ﬁrst half mainly due to Ogden. It's just important to note that we do continue to project proﬁtability on all underwriting years. Changing topics to look now at capital and dividends, ﬁrstly capital. A pretty similar picture here to six months ago with a strong solvency ratio at 214%, which is largely in line, slightly higher than the position at the end of 2016. The only really signiﬁcant movements in the half year were the economic proﬁt oﬀsets by the interim dividend. And so much more a normal six-month period than the second half of 2016. Just to give an update on the calculation of the capital requirements and the internal model, the basis of the solvency capital requirement remains the Standard Formula plus the capital add-on. And the work on the internal model development continues. So, as you can see, we have decided to increase the scope of the model beyond just UK motor insurance risk to also capture market risk. We believe that will lead to a more concrete model of the most important risks to the Admiral Group. Now, inevitably the work involved in building, developing, testing, validating and so on, that bigger model has led to a delay in the expected application dates, which we now Company Name Admiral Group PLC expect them to be in the latter part of 2018. As we said over the past few results announcements, we formally conﬁrm our target solvency range once that internal model position is clear. Moving now to the interim dividend, as you can see, the strong capital position is meant we've been able to move the interim 2017 dividend up by 10% compared to the interim 2016 payments of £0.56 per share up from £0.51. Just to note, obviously we paid the £0.119 scheme additional return on surplus capital on top of the underlying dividend in H1 2016. £0.56 represent the payout ratio of 98% of the ﬁrst half earnings but slightly higher again in the ﬁrst half of 2016. We repeat the dividend policy on the right hand side of the slides and we reiterate that we'd expect dividends to be in the order of 90% to 95% of earnings for the foreseeable future. And also to repeat the point that we don't expect to talk about any potential returns to surplus capital until we get the internal model certainty. Dividend dates are also on the bottom of the slide. To summarize the key messages from the ﬁrst section. Very pleasing to see continued growth across the group, especially again, in household and international insurance. Group proﬁts were slightly ahead, and improved results in international insurance and comparison and we continue to report a very strong solvency position, even after a fairly full payout of earnings for the ﬁrst half. £0.56 interim dividend being 10% ahead of interim 2016. That's it from me. I'll hand you over to Cristina and Lorna to discuss the UK in more detail. Thank you.",   Thanks  Good morning everyone I'm going to talk brieﬂy through the  results then go on to the UK  proﬁts and then talk about capital and the interim divid But ﬁrst up let's look at the  proﬁt This is our usual ch that shows the contributions to the overall result that come from the diﬀerent ps of the  As  mentioned the ﬁrst half proﬁt is £ million that's modestly higher than H of  That includes an improved result in the international  Losses down to £ million from £ million That's in the green And notably that includes a much lower loss in our US  operation H also saw an improved Pe Comparison result That's in the light blue You'll have to trust me on that You can't see that at all Again improved numbers there from the US operations being the key reason for that change So these positive moves were oﬀset by higher  or central expenses which is in the yellow As you can see from the text on the side that number includes the debt interest share scheme charges and  development costs And the key reasons for our higher number this year higher share scheme charges higher head count but also higher costs in  development notably from Admiral Loans Not forgetting of course the UK that's in the sort of dark blue And as you can see the UK  proﬁt was broadly ﬂat this year compared to last half year And the combination of all those factors gets you to a slightly higher H result compared to H  So I'm going to take a few minutes now to talk about the UK  proﬁt On the top of the slide we show the UK  proﬁt which now covers private car household and  Name Admiral  PLC  over the past three half year periods On the  you can see the breakdown of the UK Car  combined ratio which is obviously critical to the proﬁtability  is going to cover households shortly but as you can see that  made another proﬁt in H slightly above  despite adding more than % to the customer base and we continue to be conservative in booking loss ratios on the household  Our car  at the H proﬁt was basically in  with last year so that's explain what's going on there So you can see that one or two things in the text distort the  results we ﬂagged last year and that includes the commutation And as we said back in h we will have some residual hangover of the Og impact this year and for the next few years or ﬁnancial years The impact to this half year is approximately £ million That's enough to pull the higher current year loss ratio and lower proﬁt commission And probably the key factor is a lower reserve release this half year versus last half year As you can see % of premium is still substantial in relative terms that has that percentage being more in  with  and  then obviously we'd have seen an increased UK Car  proﬁt So why wasn't it quite as high?

It's a pleasure for me to stand today to talk about the very strong result of the UK business. I'm going to cover the main highlights except loss ratio and claims, which will be covered by Alistair. So let me start with the picture that you can see here, it was a big moment in the year when we passed plus 1 million customer in our household book, so you have here a picture of the team celebrating. It's been a good year for household growth of 17% in customers and turnover. And given that the weather in 2019 went back to normal levels, well, sorry, normal, according to the UK standards, we went back to proﬁtability. So that was a good year for household. Also in terms of our UK Motor given where we are in the cycle, we have seen very modest growth around 1% and these -- and underlying trend behind these numbers is the increase in the retention due to lot of operational improvement. So what we have in the book now is a bigger proportion of renewals, which tend to have a lower average premium. Now, let's move to pricing, which -- with a lot of things happening in the past few months. We normally put this slide, so hopefully you're very familiar with the information here. First is the market indexes that we use, the ABI in blue takes into account, new business and renewals, so it tends to have a softer changes. The new business confused index in red, where you can see sooner the trends in the market. So what we can see is that in the past few periods, prices have gone up in the market at least for new business. The data shows 5% increase year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter. That's for the market. For Admiral, you have the graph that shows Admiral Times Top, the percentage of cases that we return, the ﬁrst or best price in price comparison and indicates how our prices Company Name Admiral Group PLC versus the average of the market, that trades in price comparison. It's indexed to 2017. Now, I want to highlight a couple of things. The ﬁrst one is that as you can see since 20 months, we have been putting prices up versus the rest of the market. Secondly that we continue doing so in the second half of 2019. So as you can see the trend in the second half, we have continued putting prices up, even though the market has done it, our increases have been overall higher. In the past couple of months, you see a small uptick. We have continued putting prices up, but we believe that the market has put prices up slightly more. Now the question is what is going to happen during the rest of 2020 and is a very diﬃcult question. So I have put a slide to try to summarize every eﬀect that could happen in the market. So let's start with whiplash reforms. So it's just been announced a delay on these reforms. We expect now that they will happen in August that has given us a bit more certainty about when they will happen. However, there is a lot of uncertainty about what is going to be the actual reform. This is still being discussed. But also, what is the impact going to be. So in terms of prices, we don't think there is going to be a big impact at least in the ﬁrst half of the year and in Admiral, what we're not planning to take any change at the moment in our prices because of this reform. We're going to be cautious about it. Second thing to take into account is the outcome of the FCA market pricing study, very diﬃcult to predict what is going to happen. But I think overall, we can or something that could happen is that after the results are announced around June, there could be pressure to increase prices on new business and maybe reduce renewals and companies that have large renewals book with high tenure, might be more aﬀected. In the case of Admiral, in the case of our Motor book, 80% of our customers shop and they call us every year. So we have quite an active book of shoppers. Therefore, we hope that the impact is going to be less on us. However, this is a regulatory reform, until we see exactly what is going to be, we're going to be very cautious about it. And the other impacts that we're going to see our excess of loss. At the beginning of this year, the excess of loss costs have gone up. They have put up with the changes in Ogden. Some external parties are saying that the increases have been around 5% to 10% in the minimum cases up to 35%. It's important to note that in Admiral versus a lot of competitors, our excess of loss cover tends to be smaller than the risk, and therefore the impact of this increase overall is smaller. And ﬁnally, claims inﬂation, Alistair is going to talk a lot about it, but in general, we'll continue having claims inﬂation, and I'll put pressure on prices. So with all these uncertainty and information, we believe we are going to continue to see prices going up in the market, at least in the ﬁrst half of the year. What is going to happen in the second half will be also very much inﬂuenced by the FCA market study and the whiplash reform. We're moving on to expenses. We have seen in 2019, a small uptick. Two main reasons behind. The ﬁrst one, as you can see in the waterfall graph, it's an increase in levies. The second one is a continuation of our -- and the spend that we're doing to strengthen our Company Name Admiral Group PLC business around areas like analytics, technology, cyber and also the implementation of a lot of regulatory change and strengthening in governance. Now, all these spend in making our systems stronger and our online capabilities also good, have an impact on what the customers can do. So today, Admiral Elephant customers can do most of the changes online. They can take a policy. And what we're seeing very clear is that customers like that channel. So every time we put new functionalities online, there is a very increase in take -- in the take-up. I have put here a graph of Elephant customers, just to show that in one year, the number of online interactions have doubled, and this deﬁnitely will have an impact on our expenses going forward. So overall in terms of expenses, we haven't changed our culture. We are very focused on having a lean operation. Our staﬀ, our shareholders, and they also understand even better the value of every investment and how it impact. So I believe that our expenses going forward won't necessarily keep increasing. However, we'll remain open and ﬂexible, and we'll value the investments that can come and see the value that it can have for the business. So moving on in terms of household, I was talking about good growth behind this, is growth of Admiral in the price comparison channel, but also is the growth of our multicover proposition. We oﬀer to the customers a convenient policy, you can buy several products in the same policy, you get discounts and it takes much shorter. We're very proud that anybody who wants to buy a household insurance with us can get a price in four questions. In terms of claims in household, we have seen a continuation of inﬂation especially around escape of water, although the rate of inﬂation has been lower than in previous years for both the market and for Admiral. Now, I'll talk about the recent storms, Ciara, Dennis, Jorge, even though they are not impacting this result, I think it's interesting to see the impact so far what we know is that the incurred that we have seen so far has been 14 million gross. So when you take into account, the ﬂood rig eﬀect, we are around 5 million. So let me, just summarize the key message. Strong UK Motor proﬁt. Market prices up, and we expect this trend to continue in the ﬁrst half of the year. Uncertainties in the second half. Our expense ratio increased due to levies. but also due to investment for the long term. And ﬁnally, our continued growth in household. Now before I pass you to Alistair, I just want to talk about an award that we got a few weeks ago. We have been given a lifetime award for being the only company that has been part of The Best Companies to Work for, according to the Sunday Times since the beginning 20 years ago. And for me, I think it's a very clear reﬂection of the strong culture that we have, but also of how continues and how consistent that culture has been for the past 20 years. I think it puts us in a very good place for the future, and it's a great testament of the work that we do. So that's it for me. And now to ﬁnd much more about claims, and loss ratio, I leave you with Alistair.

Welcome to our Q3 update. As usual, I'm joined by Penny James and other members of my management team. Hopefully you've had a chance to read our trading update and have your questions ready. But ﬁrst, let me run you through the highlights. We delivered another robust trading performance in Q3 as markets continued to be competitive. We believe our performance reﬂects the value of our strong brands, propositions and customer relationships. Motor and Home own brands performed well, both growing in-force policies. Our investments in direct Commercial and Rescue helped them also to grow in-force policies by 7% and 11%, respectively. We're also pleased with the strategic progress we've made in the quarter. And we're on track to begin the rollout of our new personal lines IT systems next year. Overall, our strong trading performance means that we are reiterating our full year Company Name Direct Line Insurance Group PLC and medium-term combined operating ratio target of between 93% and 95%, assuming normal annual weather and no change to the Ogden discount rate. So now for a few words on each of the business areas, starting with Motor. And at the end of Q3, our view of the year's current year loss ratio hasn't changed materially from how we described it at the half year. At the half year, we said that the market was rational, with market premiums adjusting to reﬂect the changing Ogden outlook. We also said that claims inﬂation have returned. During the quarter, market prices showed signs of stabilizing. Against this, higher damage severity has led us to nudge up our view of underlying claims inﬂation towards the top end of the 3% to 5% range. Weather eﬀects also drove higher frequency this year after a very benign 2017 experience. Against this backdrop, we put through some rate increases. Although not quite enough to cover claims inﬂation in the quarter, the business we wrote was still at our target loss ratios. Having priced a little ahead of the market, we're pleased that we still achieved some growth. Our own brand policies grew 0.7% compared to Q2, taking year-on-year growth to 3%. Low average premiums meant that our own brands' GWP was down a little compared with last year as our price increases were more than oﬀset by a lower risk mix. This mix change resulted from reﬁnements to our technical price models and to our pricing strategy -- and to our promotional strategy, I should say. As usual, we'll continue to prioritize our target loss ratios over volume. Moving on to Home. We're pleased with the way we traded in Q3. Own brands policy count was up a little. And average premiums were 1% ahead of Q3 last year. We achieved good price increases on our new business and also improved retention a little in the quarter. Most of the year-on-year variance in headline premium and policies continued to be the runoﬀ of the Nationwide and Sainsbury's businesses. Finally, a few words on the weather in the quarter. At the half year, we talked about the potential for 2018 to be a subsidence year. But I'm pleased to report that our latest view suggests subsidence claims, whilst higher, will not materially be higher than we would normally expect. Next, onto Rescue, where it was another strong quarter for our Green Flag brands, which grew premiums 13.2% compared to last year. And in other personal lines, I'm delighted to announce that we've just agreed to renew our travel partnership with Nationwide to continue to supply travel insurance to their bank customers for another ﬁve years. In Commercial, our investment in Direct Line for Business progressed well in the quarter and remains in line with our plans. DL4B grew premiums 7.6% compared to last year. Overall, Commercial premiums were ﬂat in the quarter as NIG exited several larger risks when we weren't -- which we were not expected to meet our internal hurdle rates, oﬀsetting the premium growth in DL4B. Company Name Direct Line Insurance Group PLC And now for the outlook, where our ongoing discipline gives us the conﬁdence that we can achieve our combined operating ratio target of between 93% and 95% in 2018 and over the medium term, supported by ongoing reductions in our cost and commission ratios. This still seems at a normalized annual weather load and no change to the Ogden discount rate. For investments, we continue to expect investment return of about GBP 150 million this year, boosted by GBP 30.5 million of gains that we recognized in the ﬁrst half. So in summary, we're pleased with how we traded this quarter. Markets remain competitive. And we maintain strong momentum across our own brand portfolio as we continue to beneﬁt from our ongoing investments. And with that, operator, we'll go to questions.

Welcome to our full year results. Thank you to Morgan Stanley for hosting us here in Canary Wharf and congratulations to those that have made it in. Nice to see you all. As usual, I'm joined by our CFO, John Reizenstein, and also Mike Holliday-Williams is going to share his thoughts on a few key topics a bit later. Other members of my Executive Committee are generally on the front row, and you can ask them questions after maybe over a vol-au-vent. So we're going to begin with a brief overview of the highlights before handing over to John. So we think these are a good set of results in 2015 as we continue to benefit from our long-term improvement program. At the start of 2015, we rearticulated our strategy. And on slide three you can see that, I'm sure you'll agree, some pretty good numbers, all of which demonstrate that the initiatives which underpin our strategy are working. We're making real progress in becoming a great retailer again. We're more competitive. Customers are responding well to our services and to our propositions. And Direct Line is the most preferred brand in the market, with Churchill at number two. All of this has led to growth in our Motor and Home own brand portfolio. And we're getting more efficient. Our ongoing focus has helped us to reduce our cost base again down 4.6%. One of the ways we're doing this is by managing customer claims more efficiently through digital channels. And this has led to faster settlement times. We're also moving back to becoming a disruptor again. Telematics policies more than doubled. Green Flag continued to challenge the AA and the RAC, and Direct Line for Business broke through 400,000 policies. And our clear strategy has also enabled us to meet or exceed our targets in 2015. We delivered a combined ratio of 94%, which adjusted for normal weather was 93% and better than the guidance we set out at the start of the year. RoTE increased again to 18.5%, well ahead of our 15% target. Shareholders are also sharing the success with a 5% increase in the regular dividend and an additional special dividend of 8.8p, taking total dividends to over £1.5 billion since the IPO. I'm really proud of the progress we've made in 2015. Later on, Mike and I are going to tell you more about how we achieved it and how we intend to keep it going in 2016. So, let me now hand over to John for the numbers.",   Okay Good morning ladies and gentlemen Welcome to our full year results Thank you to   for hosting us here in Canary Wharf and congratulations to those that have made it in e to see you all As usual I'm joined by our CFO   and also  -s is going to share his thoughts on a few key topics a bit later Other members of my   are generally on the front row and you can ask them questions after maybe over a vol-au-vent So we're going to begin with a brief overview of the highlights before handing over to  So we think these are a good set of results in  as we continue to benefit from our long-term improvement program At the st of  we reiculated our  And on slide three you can see that I'm sure you'll agree some pretty good numbers all of which demonstrate that the initiatives which unpin our  are working We're making real progress in becoming a great retailer again We're more competitive Customers are resding well to our services and to our propositions And Direct Line is the most preferred brand in the market with rchill at number two All of this has led to growth in our Motor and Home own brand portfolio And we're getting more efficient Our ongoing focus has helped us to reduce our cost base again down % One of the ways we're doing this is by managing customer claims more efficiently through digital channels And this has led to faster settlement times We're also moving back to becoming a disruptor again Telematics policies more than doubled  Flag continued to challenge the AA and the RAC and Direct Line for  broke through  policies And our clear  has also enabled us to meet or exceed our targets in  We ivered a combined ratio of % which adjusted for normal weather was % and better than the guidance we set out at the st of the year RoTE increased again to % well ahead of our % target Sharehols are also sharing the success with a % increase in the regular divid and an additional special divid of p taking total divids to over £ billion since the IPO I'm really proud of the progress we've made in  Later on  and I are going to tell you more about how we achieved it and how we intend to keep it going in  So let me now hand over to  for the numbers,morning lady gentleman year result congratulation e thought topic bit member row question vol au vent overview highlight set result term improvement program slide number initiative progress retailer customer service proposition line brand market rchill number growth brand portfolio focus cost base % way customer channel settlement time disruptor policy flag aa rac line policy target ratio % weather % guidance year % target sharehol success % increase divid divid divid ipo progress number,"['congratulation', 'think', 'topic', 'member', 'row', 'vent', 'overview', 'highlight', 'set', 'program', 'initiative', 'progress', 'retailer', 'service', 'proposition', 'brand', 'rchill', 'brand', 'base', 'channel', 'settlement', 'disruptor', 'policy', 'flag', 'aa', 'rac', 'policy', 'weather', 'guidance', 'success', 'ipo', 'progress']",63,395,35,6.26984126984127,1.8,32,0.003420659,0.0034970222,0.0042772717,0.0035105303,0.0038954802,0.0317886,0.0012593943,0.0031774032,0.002568209,0.0039467635,0.002882347,0.0020622262,0.030452766,0.17664647,0.6937835,0.0010139507,0.00075495744,0.0019060813,0.0021241659,0.0036095812,0.0037630412,0.0053782207,0.0049709287,0.0010796672,0.0019477294,0.0017020551,0.0016733495,0.0029075881,topic_15

So ﬁrst looking at 2017-2018, as Lance has said, we expect to deliver growth in underlying proﬁt from last year of between 1% and 2%. In terms of the trading in Retail Broking, we have seen a signiﬁcant uplift in competitor activity in both home and motor in Q4 since our last market update with some players aggressively targeting volume growth, which has led to lower persistency for a period. We expect this increased level of competitive activity to continue and, therefore, our proﬁt growth in our retail broker is expected to be marginally lower during the initial two years of investment than previously anticipated. The cost associated with Monarch were caused by a range of factors. Where we had passengers in resort, we had to pay for the ﬂights to bring those customers home. Where we had future passengers who were booked on Monarch ﬂights as part of one of our packages, we had to acquire new ﬂights at higher cost and then, clearly, we also had some cancellation. For the full year, we expect our written broking performance to be positive year-on-year with a strong performance in motor even after the tougher Q4 trading, partially oﬀset by home and travel broking. On an earned basis, the proﬁtability of our Retail Broking Company Name Saga PLC business will reduce year-on-year due to the lower return to earned beneﬁt, which I'll touch on in a minute. Even after those eﬀects of Monarch, we will deliver another strong uplift in our Travel proﬁt. And ﬁnally, our claims experience within the underwriter continues to be very positive for small and large PI, which has enabled us to maintain reserve releases at roughly the same level year-on-year. Now turning to next year, we expect to signiﬁcantly improve our quality of earnings with an increase in proﬁts coming from Retail Broking and Travel. Around half of this increase is expected to come from the organic growth in this business and the other half from a lower cost base. We have taken the actions to deliver these cost reductions, the majority of which is driven by lower head count. And as a result, there will be a one-oﬀ charge in the current ﬁnancial year of approximately £4 million. Oﬀsetting these improvements, we expect to experience reductions in reserve releases and one-oﬀ earnings of around £20 million. This headwind will be roughly half and half split between lower reserve releases and a reduction in written to earned beneﬁt. The written to earned beneﬁts have been a constant proﬁt beneﬁt of between £10 million and £20 million since the time of IPO. And these result from the standard accounting treatment which aﬀects the timing of recognition of proﬁt between underwritten and broke policies. We have moved more towards a less capital intensive model and taken less underwriting risk in AICL. Therefore, AICL has written less business sold by our retail broker, both on ancillary product and with the introduction of the motor panel 2 1/2 years ago. Also, the introduction of the arrangement fee, which is standard in the insurance industry, had an eﬀect on this written to earned beneﬁt. In summary, this is happening because we have increased the number of policies we broke and reduced the level of underwriting risk in the business. In terms of debt and leverage, there are no implications for any covenants and we expect our leverage ratio to remain below 3 times, including the debt associated with both shifts. So, just to recap on where that leads us, the current year underlying PBT where we expect to be between 1% and 2% growth year-on-year and there will be a one-oﬀ restructuring charge of £4 million to deliver that £10 million cost reduction. Next year, proﬁt will reduce by around 5% year-on-year reﬂecting that up-front investment in customer acquisition and those ﬁnancial headwinds. And for 2020 and beyond, it's too early to give speciﬁc guidance, but we will see a better quality of earnings and proﬁt growth. Retail Broking and Travel will be beneﬁting from the investment in customer acquisition. Cruise will beneﬁt from the new cruise ship and all this from a lower cost base and a stronger business platform. I'll now hand back to Lance.",   Thanks  So ﬁrst looking at - as  has said we expect to iver growth in unlying proﬁt from last year of between % and % In terms of the trading in Retail Broking we have

As you know this is my ﬁrst set of results since taking over as Group CFO on the January 1. It is nice to see some familiar faces here. For those of you who don't know me, my background is very much in insurance. I joined from Zurich, where I was most recently the UK CFO. And in total, I spent about 28 years in the insurance industry with Zurich, a number of investment banks, and with PWC. But before I give you a summary of the results, I thought I would highlight some initial and very brief thoughts on Saga. I'd just start by saying that underneath the gravity of what we're announcing today, there is a strong business. Even at the level of our rebased earnings, Saga's Insurance operations are proﬁtable and well-positioned, with a large Company Name Saga PLC number of loyal customers who mainly come to us on a direct basis. And we, of course, also have a strong oﬀering in Travel. However, the company has labored to deliver a level of proﬁtability that met expectations set some time ago, but that they're not sustainable. I'm now focused on working with Lance and the team to help us grasp the nettle and making the changes that will start to address our challenges. Now, I'll be talking to you twice today. First, I'm going to talk about the 2018/2019 results. I'm not going to go into the details here. But what the aim is to give you some information on the key trends in our numbers, and to help you understand the context for our starting point. Later, I will come back and explain the ﬁnancial impacts of the new strategy. So, turning to results, and there are really two key moving parts. First, Retail Broking proﬁtability reduced sharply compared to the previous year. This was partly because we started the year with a smaller book of renewal customers. But the bigger challenge, particularly in the last six months, has been a signiﬁcant decline in new business margins. For reasons that I will come back to shortly, we expect a further decline in Broking proﬁt before tax in the next two years. This decline in the level of earnings expectations for Retail Broking has required us to impair the value of Insurance goodwill, which has in turn led to us reporting a net loss for the 2018/2019 ﬁnancial year. The second main feature of our results is a very high level of reserve releases from our underwriter. While this has been a big and recurring positive in recent years, for reasons I will explain, we expect the contribution from AICL to signiﬁcantly reduce in the next few years. Travel had a solid year, and we continue to make very good progress in Cruise. The start of this year has been somewhat challenging in Tour Ops as it has been for the whole industry. And our Tour revenues are down around 3% compared to the prior period. Now, in a year of challenge, there are two key positives in our results. First, we achieved the cost saving targets we set out a year ago. And second, we remain very proﬁtable, and the conversion of earnings to cash has continued to be very good. Let me now go into some more details. Overall, underlying proﬁt before tax is in line with the guidance we gave the market 12 months ago. But of course, the mix of proﬁts is very diﬀerent to what was expected. Underwriting outperformed, but not in a way that is likely to be sustainable. Oﬀsetting this, Retail Broking have a tough year, and we do expect a further decline in Broking earnings in 2019/2020. This reduction has two important consequences. Most importantly, it has been a signiﬁcant factor in the Board's decision to reduce the full-year dividend from £0.09 per Company Name Saga PLC share to £0.04. Second, it has also led us to impair goodwill relating to the Insurance business by £310 million. Turning now to the divisional results. As you can see on this slide, the biggest change in our results has been in Retail Broking, where proﬁt before tax reduced by £25 million. This was partially oﬀset by higher Underwriting earnings and an improvement in Emerging Businesses and Central Costs. Most of the change in this latter category is explained by one-oﬀ charges in the 2017/2018 results, and one-oﬀ gain in the 2018/2019 numbers. Now, to provide more explanation of the performance of Broking, I included some additional information on the next slide that shows a walk from 2017/2018 results to 2018/2019 proﬁt before tax. And what you can see here is that overall Broking proﬁt before tax reduced by £17 million on a written basis. That is excluding the impact of the written to earned adjustments. And there are four main items here. The biggest is an £11 million decline in the contribution from home and motor new business. There are a number of reasons why this has happened. First, the group set a priority to stabilize the home and motor policy count, with a conscious decision to win – to reduce pricing to win more new business. Second, a lot more new business was sourced from price comparison websites. This business typically has lower margins and higher acquisition costs than the business Saga has traditionally written on a direct basis. Third, external factors, such as GDPR, have had an adverse impact on volumes and acquisition costs. And last, as other insurers have noted, the market was competitive through much of last year. The second main item impacting last year is a reduction in renewal earnings particularly on the home book. This is a product of a smaller renewal book due to lower new business in the 2017/2018 year, and higher net rates from panel insurers. It was, however, for the most part expected. The third item is a loss of £5 million relating to the impact of adverse claims experienced on proﬁt share arrangements for the PMI product. This charge is expected to be one-oﬀ. Indeed, we are now starting to see the beneﬁt on changes in policy terms coming through in improved claims experience, with this also starting to be recognized in the net rates charged by our insurer. We have a very good PMI proposition for customers. And this is a signiﬁcant contributor to the earnings from other products. And fourth, going the other way, we reduced Retail Broking operating expenses by £7.7 million, which was ahead of target. Now, as I mentioned, the challenges we've faced in the last 12 months are likely to be ongoing. And as I explain on the next slide, we expect a further decline in proﬁtability in Broking in the current year. There are two main reasons why we think this will happen, and each has a broadly similar impact. First, the reduced level of margin in last year's new business will lead to reduction in renewal business proﬁtability in the next few years. Second, as Lance has explained, we Company Name Saga PLC anticipate changing our approach to renewal pricing. While there is a £5 million positive expected in PMI, given the one-oﬀ loss in last year's results, these pressures mean that run rate earnings for the Broking business are expected to be between £15 million and £25 million lower in the current year, and with an additional £10 million impact expected on earnings for the year after. This reduction in future earnings expectations is what is behind our decision to reassess the carrying value of Insurance goodwill, and to impair this by £310 million. As required by accounting standards, we have taken a fairly prudent valuation approach here. And we have not included the beneﬁts of the strategic relaunch that Gary will shortly talk about. But of course, there is no getting around the fact that this is a disappointing outcome. Next, I will talk to the performance of the Underwriting business. As you can see on this slide, both of the last two years have seen a very high level of reserve releases, and a level that is signiﬁcantly above future expectations. There are two main reasons why this has happened. First, our actuaries have put greater weight on positive recent claims trends within best estimate reserving. This leads to one-oﬀ reserve beneﬁts of £32 million in the most recent year, and around £20 million in the year before. Second, a historically very prudent approach to initial loss picks has supported ongoing very high levels of reserve releases, further helped by benign large loss experience in the last 12 months. I show this in more detail in the next slide, where I set out the more recent accident year loss ratios. What I show here on the left hand chart is the initial booked loss ratio and the current booked loss ratio for the Saga motor book. The diﬀerence between the two is the reserve releases in the most recent and prior years. This shows that Saga took a very prudent view of the initial loss picks from 2010 to 2013, with booked loss ratios in the mid-90s. Another key factor has been the beneﬁt from a signiﬁcant improvement in claims experience relative to expectations. There are multiple reasons for this. But one of them has been the implementation of the LASPO reforms in 2013. This has helped to support benign underlying claims trends for pretty much the whole motor insurance industry, and has been a key reason why reserve releases have been so positive. In recent years, however, and in line with AICL's role within the group, the beneﬁts of benign claims experience has been increasingly reﬂected in both pricing and reserving. This means that, while we still hold the same level of explicit margin and there may well be prudence in large loss reserves for recent accident years, we don't expect these to develop to anything like the levels seen in some of the previous years. In terms of current claims inﬂation, this is generally running in line with expectations. So, to cut to the chase, we do expect a couple more years of high reserve releases, but we expect our reported combined ratio to trend to around 97% in the next three years. Let me now turn to other aspects of our results. Our Travel business had an overall solid year. As we've reported previously, within Tour Ops, there are considerable pressures at the more commoditized end of the market, which is our stays and where we saw passenger numbers decline by 7%. Equally, we are seeing a much more resilient performance from our diﬀerentiated holidays propositions, including tours, river cruise and third-party cruise. This shift in mix has supported the improvement in gross proﬁt per passenger, and has enabled us to hold Tour Ops proﬁts ﬂat on the prior year. Company Name Saga PLC In Cruise, we had a good year. Growth in revenues was partly down to lower days in dock. But it was also down to strong demand for the ﬁnal season of the Pearl II ship. In terms of forward bookings, we are not immune to the same pressures as other travel companies. In terms of forward bookings, we are not immune to the same pressures as other travel companies with Tour Ops revenues around 3%, down for current departures in comparison to last year. It is a headwind, but I wouldn't say it is a big issue for us. And more importantly, we continue to make very good progress on forward bookings for the new cruise ships, where we remain on track with the business plan assumptions. As I set out on the next slide, we also made good progress in reducing our cost base. Here, I shall walk from 2017/18 expenses to 2018/19. The main point to highlight is that the target set at the beginning of the year, that is to reduce in-year admin costs by £10 million, was achieved. As was signaled back at the time, some of these savings were reinvested in marketing costs, which increased by £6 million. This included additional marketing for the new cruise ships plus higher acquisition costs within the Insurance business. We will continue to put a high priority in improving eﬃciency and absorbing inﬂationary pressures over the next ﬁve-year period. On the next slide, I show Saga's operating cash generation, which has been one of the group's real strengths. As you can see from this walk, we generated operating free cash ﬂow of around £181 million in the year, a small increase in comparison to the year before. On this basis, we converted roughly 80% of EBITDA to cash during the year, which enabled us to reduce net debt by around £40 million. There were a few moving parts here. And naturally, future cash generation will be impacted by lower Insurance earnings. But the point remains that the group has a good track record of turning proﬁts into cash, and using this to reduce leverage. I realized this has been a relatively quick (003132) through quite a lot of moving parts in our results. My main focus here has been to give you a view on the ﬁnancial context for today's announcements, particularly as it relates to Insurance. And with that, I'll now hand over to Gary, who will take you through our strategy for Retail Broking. Thank you.",   Thank you  and good morning As you know this is my ﬁrst set of results since taking over as  CFO on the uary  It is nice to see some familiar faces here For those of you who don't know

It's a great pleasure to welcome you to what is actually our third set of results that we've put out since we became a public company. Lots of familiar faces in the room, welcome back, and a few new faces as well, very good to see you. Welcome to you also. In terms of the agenda for this morning, I'm going to give you an overview of the results for the last six months, a reminder about our strategy, I'll give you some more information about the shipping decision that we've announced this morning, I'm going to have a look at the operational performance in a bit more detail, and then I'll hand over to Jonathan, our CFO, and Jonathan will take you through the numbers in more detail before ﬂipping back over to me. I will then look at our priorities in the future and, of course, we've got some time set aside for Q&A. Now at our prelims six months ago, I was very proud of the fact that a year in as a plc, we had absolutely delivered on the key objectives. So, I'm pleased to be able to say now, six months later, that we've made a very good start to the ﬁrst half of our new year and we have delivered a strong set of results. Trading EBITDA from our core Financial Services and Travel businesses is up by 5.2%. That has been partially oﬀset by the fact that we now have a full half year of plc costs, which, of course, we didn't have in the same period last year when we were still a private company. Now, that delta will wash through and it won't apply starting in the second half. Company Name Saga PLC Group Trading EBITDA has grown by 0.8% to £131 million. And we've grown Trading Proﬁt, we've grown PBT, we've grown earnings per share, and we've also generated high levels of cash, allowing us to further reduce our net debt position. All of this means that we are conﬁdent of achieving our full year proﬁt expectations and it supports the announcement of our maiden interim dividend of £0.022. Now, a quick reminder of the strategy that I outlined back in January at our Capital Markets Day for building on our position as the UK's leading provider of products and services for the over 50s. What we said then was we're going to deliver sustainable shareholder returns by ﬁrstly, unlocking the growth potential in our core businesses; secondly, investing strategically in the business to generate future growth opportunities including, for example, the announcement on a cruise ship that we've made today. And thirdly, maintaining our capital eﬃcient model. How are we going to do that? Well, ﬁrstly, by expanding our insurance footprint beyond the relatively modest market share that we have today. Secondly, growing our travel businesses through the strong brands that we've got, the portfolio of brands and everexpanding range of itineraries for our customers; thirdly, broadening our personal ﬁnance oﬀerings and, in particular, the launch of Saga Investment Services, which we'll talk more about in a minute; fourth, enhancing the Saga database and the use of that database. It's a very important resource within the company and it's full of rich data. And ﬁnally, continuing to assess ways that we can develop the business through innovative ideas and through processes. So, that's the reminder of what I said back in January and it is unchanged. So, what progress have we actually made since the start of the year? Well, ﬁrstly, we have grown our core book, increasing motor policy numbers and maintaining our combined operating ratio. The motor panel that we talked about a lot six months ago is now up and running. This is complementary to our in-house underwriter, AICL. It gives us access to third-party underwriters across all of our major product lines now and that should allow us to compete in parts of the market where we don't have the data or the expertise to want to underwrite the risks ourselves. We've also completed the Bennetts acquisition. We're seeing positive early signs both in terms of the performance of Bennetts as a business, but also its integration into our current operations. We continue to grow our Travel business. That's evidenced by the growth in Trading EBITDA and also forward trading data, which shows increases in both our Holiday revenues booked and also in the load factors for Cruising. The decision to invest in cruise ship capacity – in the refreshing of our cruise ship capacity, I should say, has now been taken. That investment will be transformational for our cruise business. I'm going to go into a bit more detail on that shortly. The work to develop and then launch Saga Investment Services proposition is gaining momentum. Nici AudhlamGardiner joined us as Managing Director of that business back in August. She's putting together an impressive team to lead the Saga Investment Service business. They're working very hard on our customer-led proposition, which is on track, as planned, to launch before the end of the year. Company Name Saga PLC And ﬁnally, as we projected, the sale process for Allied is due to be completed by the end of the ﬁnancial year and is on track to do so. We announced, remember, back at our Capital Markets Day in January that we had written that business down to zero. Now, before we move on to talk about the rest of the business, I want to spend a bit more time looking at two businesses, two key areas ﬁrst. First of those is Cruising and the second is motor insurance. As we have said in the past, Cruising sits right at the heart of the Saga brand. It plays a vital role in demonstrating the excellent customer service that Saga is renowned for. Our cruise operations remain extremely popular with customers. Over 98% of customers rate their experience as excellent or good. In fact, during August of this year, both Saga Sapphire and Saga Pearl achieved their best ever customer satisfactions scores. So the business is performing well, demand is high, and we remain very committed to it as a key part of the Saga oﬀer. However, we're currently running older ships. They're less eﬃcient. They cost more to maintain. They make it harder for us to provide our customers with a fantastic oﬀer that we want to. And we therefore announced today that we have taken the decision to update our shipping capacity. After a rigorous selection process, I'm very pleased to be able to tell you that we have secured the Meyer Werft shipyard in Germany for the build. We've signed a memorandum of understanding with Meyer Werft for the delivery of a new purpose built ship in 2019. And we have an option on a second ship to be delivered in 2021. We have two years to make the decision about that second ship. Cruising is a growth market. It's a market in which we have a proven track record, where demand for our oﬀering is exceeding the supply, where new ships will be transformative for our business. And the business case for this investment is extremely compelling. Jonathan's going to give you a bit more detail of that including some expectations around returns shortly. There are few images up on the screen that you can see, which show how the new ship may look. We'll be ﬁnalizing the design of the ship over the coming months with input from our customers. Safe to say it's going to be a signiﬁcant upgrade for us, whilst retaining the traditional features that our customers really value in Saga Cruises. For example, all the cabins will now have balconies, which wasn't the case on our older ships. But we'll still maintain the intimate small ship feel compared to some of the new ships out there being built with 4,000, 5,000 even 6,000 berths on them. These ships will have under 1,000, so it is the classic small ship cruising experience. There will be a high crew-to-customer ratio as we have today. And we'll retain lots of nice touches, which we know our customers value like single-seat dining, great public spaces and excellent entertainment facilities. Overall, as I've said, the decision is transformational for the proﬁtability of our cruise business and will oﬀer compelling returns. Company Name Saga PLC Let's talk a little bit more about motor insurance operations. Firstly, let me remind you of why our motor insurance business has very strong built-in strength. Firstly, we have lower acquisition costs thanks largely to our database, which now covers 11 million people in over 50s age range. At the heart of this business is Saga Services, which is the retail end of our insurance business. Saga Services is a diﬀerentiated and highly eﬀective distributor of our products. And it can choose whether it underwrites policies internally or whether it wrote them (0759) externally through the new panel. Our in-house underwriter, which we call AICL, remains in a position to price extremely competitively in the narrow space of the market in which we are true experts. That is small – low mileage, smaller cars and so on. We're very, very good at that. Finally, our claims cost are kept very low compared to industry averages. We have an excellent claims management process. Now, this model has allowed us to deliver a strong performance in motor despite the continued challenging market conditions. We have not seen the uplift in claims frequency and personal injury claims that have been reported elsewhere in the industry. Our exceptional claims handling also means that our claims costs have remained very low, helping us drive proﬁtability. Where we do agree with the market is that there are signs of sustainable premium increases coming in. This plays to our advantage. AICL's claims experience and its pricing structure allows us to compete very eﬀectively in a market where more people are starting to shop around. Now, let's be clear. The numbers that we've announced today cover the last six months. They are not yet the results of the new motor panel. The increase in customers that we've announced is an increase of market share within our core market resulting from AICL's expertise and claims experience and from Saga Services' ability to grow policy numbers. So, the core business is performing well, but there's still a lot to be done to broaden a market in which we operate. The motor panel, as I say, launched over the summer. It now has its ﬁrst two external underwriters as well as AICL underwriting policies. As a reminder, what we saw with our home panel when we launched that four or ﬁve years ago is that it becomes increasingly eﬃcient and eﬀective as more underwriters join the panel. What happens is they start to trust the data that we supply them and they start to build competitive tension into the panel. We expect to add two or three more underwriters between now and year-end, and then another two or three in the ﬁrst half of next year. The motor panel will enable us to capture market share in areas that, as I said before, a highly conservative in-house underwriter is unable to price for competitively. It might sound amazing but, historically, up to three quarters of the customers who come to us for a quote did not get competitive quote from us because we didn't really want to underwrite that risk. We will now be able to pursue the whole of that market using our motor panel. The completion of the acquisition of Bennetts, the UK's premier motorbike insurer, will also help us to drive our motor business forward. It provides a signiﬁcant opportunity for us to cross sell and to up sell products to its customer base of over 200,000 Company Name Saga PLC policyholders. Bennetts' core motorbike insurance sector is within a part of the market that's growing very strongly. And it's very close to our demographic. The majority of their customers are either over 50 or approaching 50. Early indications are that this business, as I mentioned earlier, is integrating well into the Saga Group. And we will be in a position to give you more detail on how that develops in the months to come. Trading and home insurance was very encouraging in the ﬁrst half. Trading EBITDA increased by more than 16% on the comparative period a year ago. That result was driven by the competitive pricing advantage that we get from our home panel despite a challenging marketplace. During the ﬁrst half, market premiums continued to fall, resulting in less shopping around by customers, i.e., less churn. Now, we're a relatively new entrant into the home insurance market, and so we beneﬁt in a market where there's lots of churn. And as a result, we've seen a small reduction in the core policy numbers for home in the ﬁrst half. In other ﬁnancial services, which is mostly Private Medical and Travel Insurance, core policy volumes and revenue were up, principally driven by performance of those two core businesses. The slight fall that you see in Trading EBITDA was due entirely to investment in future growth opportunities, in particular, the wealth management oﬀering, Saga Investment Services, which I mentioned before, and also Saga Legal Services. Trading for the Travel business in the ﬁrst half of the year was encouraging. Growth in Trading EBITDA, this was a result of ongoing implementation of the clear strategy that we talked about back in January and the contribution made by Destinology. We continue to win lots of awards. Saga Holidays was recently named by The Times and Sunday Times as the Specialist Tour Operator of the Year. Titan Travel was named as the Best Escorted Tour Operator. Saga Cruises was Best Value for Money Cruise Line for the second year running at the Cruise International Magazine Awards. Finally, we're focused on developing the cruise business through optimized pricing, through growing our load factors and through maintaining the excellent levels of customer satisfaction that we've got. I'm now going to hand you over to Jonathan, who's going to talk you through the numbers in a bit more detail. Thanks.",   Good morning everybody Welcome It's a great pleasure to welcome you to what is actually our third set of results that we've put out since we became a public company Lots of familiar faces in the room welcome back and a few new faces as well very good to see you Welcome to you also In terms of the agenda for this morning I'm going to give you an overview of the results for the last six months a remin about our  I'll give you some more information about the shipping decision that we've announced this morning I'm going to have a look at the operational performance in a bit more detail and then I'll hand over to  our CFO and  will take you through the numbers in more detail before ﬂipping back over to me I will then look at our priorities in the future and of course we've got some time set aside for Q&A Now at our prelims six months ago I was very proud of the fact that a year in as a plc we had absolutely ivered on the key objectives So I'm pleased to be able to say now six months later that we've made a very good st to the ﬁrst half of our new year and we have ivered a strong set of results Trading EBITDA from our core  Services and Travel es is up by % That has been pially oﬀset by the fact that we now have a full half year of plc costs which of course we didn't have in the same period last year when we were still a private company Now that ta will wash through and it won't apply sting in the second half  Name Saga PLC  Trading EBITDA has grown by % to £ million And we've grown Trading Proﬁt we've grown PBT we've grown earnings per share and we've also generated high levels of cash allowing us to further reduce our net debt position All of this means that we are conﬁt of achieving our full year proﬁt expectations and it supports the announcement of our mai interim divid of £ Now a quick remin of the  that I outd back in uary at our Capital ets  for building on our position as the UK's leading provi of products and services for the over s What we said then was we're going to iver sustainable sharehol returns by ﬁrstly unlocking the growth potential in our core es; secondly investing strategically in the  to generate future growth opporties including for example the announcement on a cruise ship that we've made today And thirdly maintaining our capital eﬃcient mo How are we going to do that? Well ﬁrstly by expanding our  footprint beyond the relatively modest market share that we have today Secondly growing our travel es through the strong brands that we've got the portfolio of brands and everexpanding range of itineraries for our customers; thirdly broaing our personal ﬁnance oﬀerings and in picular the launch of Saga  Services which we'll talk more about in a minute; fourth enhancing the Saga database and the use of that database It's a very important resource within the company and it's full of h data And ﬁnally continuing to assess ways that we can develop the  through innovative ideas and through processes So that's the remin of what I said back in uary and it is unchanged So what progress have we actually made since the st of the year? Well ﬁrstly we have grown our core book increasing motor policy numbers and maintaining our combined operating ratio The motor panel that we talked about a lot six months ago is now up and running This is complementary to our in-house unwriter AICL It gives us access to third-py unwriters across all of our major product s now and that should allow us to compete in ps of the market where we don't have the data or the expertise to want to unwrite the s ourselves We've also completed the netts acquisition We're seeing positive early signs both in terms of the performance of netts as a  but also its integration into our current operations We continue to grow our Travel  That's eviced by the growth in Trading EBITDA and also forward trading data which shows increases in both our Holiday revenues booked and also in the load factors for Cruising The decision to invest in cruise ship capacity – in the refreshing of our cruise ship capacity I should say has now been taken That  will be transformational for our cruise  I'm going to go into a bit more detail on that shortly The work to develop and then launch Saga  Services proposition is gaining momentum i AudhlamGardiner joined us
