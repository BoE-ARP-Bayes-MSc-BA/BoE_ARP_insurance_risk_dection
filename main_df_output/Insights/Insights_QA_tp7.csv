Colleagues are looking ph at me with respect to the FX effect in P&C because it's actually an accounting question, so that goes to the CFO, because again it's an accounting one, it's not an economic effect. The reason is, the stronger -- mainly the stronger US dollar in the first quarter development of the US dollar, that's the underlying reason for it. And as we re-evaluate our balance sheet, both on the liability and asset side or the liability effect flows through the P&L, that's the currency effect where it's on the asset side. Only so called liquid assets, monetary assets that are classified under IFRS flows through the P&L and the other in fact goes straight into the currency OCI for particularly our non-monetary US product assets, for example, our huge US sort of private equity portfolio. You will have seen an opposite effect last year where we reported a gain on the P&C side. So, it add a certain volatility of course to our results.

And then we had -- and that's a mechanic calculation. You have an additional operational risk because the increase was extremely material. Over 2019, we are, yes, shifting from that type of product. We're moving more to a Unit-Linked product now. We have also mentioned that we are launching new products, which means that the exceptional costs in operational risk by the end of 2018 is now going away. So the answer to your question, there is a small part due to the shift in product mix, but there is a material part, because of the reducing operational risk that we had in Q4 2018.

We completely ignore margins; it's just completely irrelevant in all our internal conversations, because it just doesn't matter. Because between a deal that has a 17-year payback and a margin of X. And a deal that has a five-year payback and a margin of Y, that just gets completely lost. We look at return on capital and payback, actually. That's also a very important consideration. So the new bulk deals we've signed tend to have a short payback because, I'm going to quote Barry here, you have to eat what you bake. The problem with very long paybacks is that the generation of management that enters in those deals is not there when they materialize. We like to keep people accountable. And that's why we like short paybacks. So really, bulk deals are written on the basis of return on capital and payback. And we just don't -- the margin quality is  immaterial .",   This is central to the way we  the  We completely ignore margins; it's just completely irrelet in all our internal conversations because it just doesn't matter Because between a deal that has a -year payback and a margin of X And a deal that has a five-year payback and a margin of Y that just gets completely lost We look at return on capital and payback actually That's also a very important consiation So the new bulk deals we've signed tend to have a short payback because I'm going to quote  here you have to eat what you bake The problem with very long paybacks is that the generation of  that enters in those deals is not there when they materialize We like to keep people able And that's why we like short paybacks So really bulk deals are written on the basis of return on capital and payback And we just don't -- the margin quality is  immaterial ,way margin conversation deal payback margin deal year payback margin return capital payback consiation deal payback problem payback generation deal people payback deal basis return capital payback margin quality,"['conversation', 'payback', 'payback', 'payback', 'consiation', 'payback', 'problem', 'payback', 'payback', 'payback']",28,180,13,6.428571428571429,2.1538461538461537,10,0.005252106,0.0074303807,0.01525212,0.009356187,0.0034418928,0.005207193,0.7162171,0.007849445,0.008135428,0.011051794,0.008490846,0.010457129,0.009322208,0.0056226472,0.09008715,0.0056376895,0.0076595917,0.012982521,0.009207574,0.0040845405,0.008712082,0.006449013,0.0009645149,0.0072898823,0.0059642443,0.007552476,0.010322229,topic_7

And I think the way Optimal Dynamics was planned, at which exchange rates, and where are we today on the exchange rates and where are we going forward. We will do an update on that at the Investor Day. Besides the exchange rate impact, your dollar and pounds and other currencies versus euro, well I think our growth business-wise at constant exchange rate is today more or less in line with what we thought it would be. So, we have no reason to believe that for this particular year we are very much outside of the Optimal Dynamics assumptions. For next year, well for us, it's very simple, we'll do whatever we can to maintain the portfolio. Obviously, we already see that in certain areas we have to let business go. As I have said, our cancelled and restructured is increasing again. If it's necessary, well, we will do what we need to do. But, again, no particular reason to warn on the possible deviation today.",   We'll address that in details at the   in September but I think the first thing and the most important thing as regard to Optimal Dynamics on the top- side is the foreign exchange impact And I think the way Optimal Dynamics was planned at which exchange rates and where are we today on the exchange rates and where are we going forward We will do an update on that at the   Besides the exchange rate impact your dollar and pounds and other currencies versus euro well I think our growth -wise at constant exchange rate is today more or less in  with what we thought it would be So we have no reason to beve that for this picular year we are very much outside of the Optimal Dynamics assumptions For next year well for us it's very simple we'll do whatever we can to maintain the portfolio Obviously we already see that in certain areas we have to let  go As I have said our cancelled and restructured is increasing again If it's necessary well we will do what we need to do But again no picular reason to warn on the possible deviation today,detail thing thing regard side exchange impact way exchange rate today exchange rate update exchange rate impact dollar pound currency euro growth exchange rate today reason year assumption year portfolio area reason deviation today,"['exchange', 'exchange', 'exchange', 'exchange', 'dollar', 'pound', 'currency', 'euro', 'exchange', 'deviation']",31,186,11,6.0,2.8181818181818183,10,0.005252106,0.0074303807,0.01525212,0.009356187,0.0034418928,0.005207193,0.7162171,0.007849445,0.008135428,0.011051794,0.008490846,0.010457129,0.009322208,0.0056226472,0.011373174,0.08435167,0.0076595917,0.012982521,0.009207574,0.0040845405,0.008712082,0.006449013,0.0009645149,0.0072898823,0.0059642443,0.007552476,0.010322229,topic_7
