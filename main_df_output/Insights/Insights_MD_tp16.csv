We're now coming to the formal part of our annual meeting. When you registered for the meeting, you would have been given a white plastic smart card. If you have not already done so, please insert your card into the slot at the top of the handset with the bar code at the bottom and facing towards you. Please refer to the screen behind me, which shows how to insert the smart card where (technical difficulty) Please refer to the screen behind me, which shows how to insert the smart card, or alternatively, just raise your hand and you will get some assistance. When inserted correctly, a welcome message will appear briefly on the screen then you will be returned to the holding screen where your name will now appear at the top of the display. Once voting begins, your voting options will appear on the handset screen. To vote for a resolution, press 1; to vote against, press 2; or if you wish to abstain, press 3. Your selection and the word Received will appear on the screen confirming your vote has been cast. If you wish to change your mind prior to the poll closing, simply select a new option by pressing 1, 2 or 3. Your original vote will be canceled and your new selection will be counted. If you wish to cancel your vote prior to the poll closing and have no selection recorded, press the button marked an X. Once a poll is closed the results will be displayed on the screen showing the combination of votes cast in the room and the proxies received prior to the meeting. There are a number of procedural matters to which I must also draw your attention. This is a shareholders meeting. And therefore, only shareholders, their attorneys, proxies and authorized company representatives are entitled to speak or vote. I ask that questions be confined to the business of the meeting and shareholder issues. Each item of business will be discussed in turn and shareholders will have the opportunity to ask questions on that item. Please save your questions on individual items until we reach that item. Directors and members of senior management will be available after the meeting to answer more individual questions you may have. Proxy holders should note that all directed votes have been accumulated and recorded. Only proxy holders with open votes are asked to record a vote in favor or against a resolution or an abstention. As set out in the notice of the meeting, as the Chairman of the meeting, I will be voting all available proxies in favor of each item of business, except resolution 2 on the adoption of the remuneration report per the Corporations Act. If you need to leave this meeting early but would still like to lodge a poll vote, please speak to the Computershare staff at the reception desk who will be able to assist you in recording your vote. This year, we again asked shareholders to submit questions prior to the meeting. While we have not provided individual responses, the key themes within the questions have been answered through mine and John's addresses. We thank the shareholders for taking the time to submit questions as we really do value your views. Shareholders entitled to ask questions and vote have been issued with a Lumi device. In order to assist me, I request that you display the Lumi device to the microphone attendant before speaking on a resolution. Other attendees may have a blue, green or a white card. A blue card means that you are a joint shareholder. That is the second holder on a jointly registered shareholding. You can speak to a resolution. But you are not entitled to vote on a resolution. A white card means you are a visitor. You can neither ask a question nor vote on a resolution. A green card means you are from the media. Again, you can neither ask a question nor vote on a resolution. During question time, I would ask shareholders to kindly use the microphones that are placed strategically throughout the auditorium so that we can all hear you clearly. Please show either your Lumi device or a blue card and give your name and any organization which you represent to the microphone attendant who will introduce you to the meeting. I will select the microphone from which I will take the next question. All right, item 1 on the agenda is to receive and consider the financial statements. I would propose that the meeting receives the financial reports and the reports of the directors and auditors for the year ended December 31, 2016. In accordance with the Corporations Act, I will allow a reasonable opportunity for shareholders as a whole to ask questions about or comment on the management of the company. Also, in accordance with the Corporations Act, I will allow a reasonable opportunity for shareholders as a whole to ask the auditors who are present at this meeting question relevant to the conduct of the audit, the preparation and content of the auditor's report, the accounting practices adopted in the financial statements and the independence of the auditor. I invite any questions from shareholders on the accounts and reports only. Any questions related to the remuneration report should be raised when we come to that portion of the meeting. In fairness to all shareholders, could I ask that you restrict yourself to no more than 2 questions at any 1 time? So we will now open it up for questions.
