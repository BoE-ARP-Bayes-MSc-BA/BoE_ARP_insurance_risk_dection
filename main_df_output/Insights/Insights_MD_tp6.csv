So we have a large customer base of over 2.8 million customers and a strong brand recognition of over 80%.

Now, after all those details regarding the financial performance in 2016, I would now like to come to the last part of our presentation and give you an update on our strategy. We will start on slide number 22. One year ago, in March 2016, we announced our new helvetia 20.20 strategy. The new strategy makes us fit for the future. Ladies and gentlemen, you already know these slides, but once again, fit means that our product offerings and sales channels are becoming more innovative and increasingly digital, and we, as an organization, become more agile and efficient. By combining our strengths with new opportunities, we want to focus even more intensely on the needs of our customers. With that, I would like to move on to slide 23. Over the past months, we have been fine-tuning the details for implementing the helvetia 20.20 strategy. The implementation is based on our vision of being the leading Swiss all-lines insurer, with a national and an international ambition, digital and innovative, and with a highly developed customer focus. Together with our objectives of accelerating profitable growth, enhancing efficiency and delivering quality, as well as with our financial targets, this forms the basis for the implementation framework. I will continue on slide 24. As you can see on this slide, the new framework comprises 16 groupwide strategic initiatives and ensures a consistent and well-managed implementation of helvetia 20.20. Every initiative is sponsored by a member of the senior management. All initiatives have been designed to accelerate profitable growth, enhance efficiency and deliver quality. Sixteen initiatives, of course, sounds like a lot. To obtain a holistic view however, we also included internal initiatives that form the basis for the successful strategy implementation. For instance, future-oriented IT systems or an effective CRM. Other initiatives such as value-creating capital management or strong international positionings are not new for us and we have been constantly working on these topics in any case. Due to their strategic importance for the entire group, however, they have been included in the framework as well. I will now move to slide 25. Over the past months, we have already been working with the framework, as well as starting our initiatives. And therefore, we already achieved important milestones in various areas. Within the next minutes, I'm happy to provide you with some insights regarding selected initiatives. Those on which I want to take a closer look at are shaded in green. In December 2016, Helvetia successfully concluded Project ONE. The project focused on combing the group and the market unit (4040) Switzerland functions defining an adequate organizational structure and nominating the relevant functional executives. Vacancies in the newly created executive management area of Non-Life Switzerland and IT, as well as in the new support function, Corporate Development, have already been successfully filled. The new structure has been operative since January 1, 2017. Both the board of directors and the Executive Management furthermore focused on designing an implementation framework for helvetia 20.20 as just discussed on the previous slide. Project ONE also looked at individual issues such as the future growth strategy of the direct insurer smile.direct. I will give you more details on that on the following slides. Turning to slide 27, in Switzerland, we are very well positioned. Helvetia is already able to serve all customer segments, pure direct customers, hybrid customers and traditional offline customers. With smile.direct, Helvetia has the only direct insurer in Switzerland that is already very well established on the market and repeatedly achieves top results in terms of quality, service and quotes in independent comparison tests. According to our own estimates, smile.direct has a market share of 22% of the Swiss online market. Please have a look at the following short film. It shows how smile.direct is working and aiming to enhance its services. Video Presentation (4242-4427) Okay, with a smile, I would like to turn on to slide 28. Ladies and gentlemen, as you have just seen, smile.direct is already well positioned in the Swiss market and continues to make a very good progress. This is the reason why we want – why we aim to further expand and strengthen its product portfolio. The ambition of smile.direct is to deliver the greatest possible benefits to its customers. In order to achieve this, the company will, according to its new strategy, realize step by step new innovations based on the customers' needs and their feedback. An example could be on-demand insurance. smile.direct also intends to offer new products that can be easily bought online as for instance, a pure risk life insurance or a building insurance in the non-life area. smile.direct will, of course, take advantage of Helvetia's product know-how. With innovations and new products, smile.direct is fostering the profitable growth of its core business. By successfully developing new partnerships, smile.direct intends to tap into new business areas and to exploit new distribution channels. This might include partnerships with other industries, such as car dealers or in the retail sector. The goal is to expand both the product offering and the customer reach. Finally, within its new strategy, smile.direct wants to develop new customer segments. Families with a high online affinity, for instance, are an ideal new customer group with a perfect fit to the smile brand offerings and services. smile.direct aims to position itself as a professional advisor for the day to day family life, and therefore, build up the ecosystem smile.family as a second foothold. Let us now move to slide 29. In order to further providing our customers with first class customer interaction and experience, one of the key pillars of our strategy is to systematically transform our business model. We are, therefore, putting emphasis on the following three key topics. First, development of ecosystems; second, corporate venturing; and third, development of own business models through an in-house incubator. We define ecosystems as an interaction, a network or a cooperation between different suppliers of solutions, service providers and customers around a particular topic such as home. The partners participating in an ecosystem will profit from gaining access to customers, while the customers themselves will benefit from a continuous and excellent customer journey. Helvetia aims to achieve a leading position in building up a home ecosystem. By acquiring 70% of MoneyPark, the largest and most advanced technology-based mortgage intermediary in Switzerland, we set forth a strong anchor in building our ecosystem, home. With MoneyPark, we are adding a new independent business model to our current portfolio. This offers us not only the possibility of tapping into new sources of revenue, but also opens up access to new customers and the broader range of products. With corporate venturing and corporate incubation, we will be taking advantage of the opportunities from targeted business model innovation, giving us the opportunity to capture new value from the markets. We have launched the Helvetia Venture Fund at the beginning of 2017. The fund invests in startups, which can contribute to the digital transformation of Helvetia's existing core business. We will invest around CHF 55 million in approximately 25 young companies over the next five years. Helvetia aims for an operational cooperation with the startups we are investing in. We are working together with b-to-v Partners in the venture capital sector. The Helvetia Venture Fund will, thus, benefit from the start-up deal flow and the experience of bto-v. Any investment decision, however, will remain with us. This allows for the necessary agility, lean processes and quick decisions for all investments. Finally, we are also putting emphasis on the development and implementation of own business innovations through our in-house incubators. With slide number 30, I would like to provide you with more details on our strategic initiative comprehensive customer access. The objective of this initiative is to enable Helvetia to achieve above market growth through relevant customer channels in the profitable private and corporate customer segments by opening new and expanding existing channels. In this context, Helvetia has initiated measures to promote SME business in Switzerland. The nonlife market in Switzerland is reasonably saturated. Nevertheless, due to our own market position, our distribution capabilities and our products, we consider the SME business to be a market segment that still offers attractive growth opportunities. Helvetia has, thus, launched a new insurance package especially for SME customers, including redesigned and simplified product coverages, which are now much more convenient and relevant for our customers, as well as for our distribution partners. With that, Helvetia is getting closer to the market leader in this segment. In addition, the new SME product also includes attractive adaptations with regard to specialty lines components such as technical insurance and cyber insurance. This enables us to make use of our dedicated know-how in providing specialty lines coverage at the point of sale, also for our SME customers and, thus, differentiates our sales from our competitors. Another strategic business area we want to push further is the mortgage business. We, therefore, launched the new sales initiative for our own tied (5211) agents. Helvetia has been successfully providing mortgages for selected customer segments for many years. A unique value proposition for our customers is the overall risk assessment, combining with financial planning and insurance advice for pension solutions, building, household and liability insurance. Mortgages do not only offer a considerable growth potential, they are also an important element of our home ecosystem. Furthermore, in this low interest rate environment, mortgages will generally remain an interesting asset class for insurance companies. Especially, when providing long-term mortgages, insurance companies do not have to hedge interest-rate risks due to the long duration of the liabilities, providing a financial advantage compared to banks. With the development of new online models, we are expanding our digital products and service range, thus, responding to the needs of the growing share of online affluent customers by making their customer experience more convenient. In Germany, for instance, only a few clicks are needed to buy a Helvetia insurance policy by digital means. All products have a modular design in order to deliver greatest possible benefits to the customers. Payment is easily arranged with PayPal, the most popular online payment service provider today. This is a service that has not been offered by any other insurance company in Germany so far. With these products, Helvetia Germany has been a first mover when it comes to a full digital insurance solution. In Spain, finally, Helvetia insurance in collaboration with Telefónica, launched the mobile application Helvetia Good Driver. Through this new app, our Spanish customers can learn about their driving habits and how to improve them, gamification of insurance-related behavior. Both the Helvetia Good Driver app, as well as the My Helvetia app that offers registered customers the possibility to consult personal (5450) data, agent's data, policies, receipts and claims data were very recently nominated among the best insurance apps in Spain. Let me now move to slide 31. Ladies and gentlemen, a lot has happened in the 2016 financial year. We are driving forward the implementation of our strategy, and I'm proud of what we have already initiated, not least, thanks to the strong commitment of our employees. Helvetia is well positioned and, therefore, I am certain that we will also be able to report on many interesting achievements on our Capital Markets Day on June 8, 2017 here in Zurich. You are already cordially invited to join us for that event. This brings us to the end of the presentation. My colleagues and I would now be pleased to answer your questions.

The Swiss insurance market is quite saturated increasing competition puts further pressure on our margins. The digital transformation changes our business model. Cost discipline is of utmost importance and the use of data will be more important than ever. With our non-life technical excellence program we exploit the potential of data, stabilize and selectively improve our margins and assure competitiveness. The program is based on two pillars, pricing underwriting portfolio management as well as advanced claims management. Our technical pricing already integrates internal and external risk customer and market data. To stabilize or selectively increase our margins, we are building new pricing mechanisms using analytical capabilities. This strategy has been jointly developed with Smile, we are able to benefit from Smile's specific experience in this area and can scale it in our core business across all distribution channels. Advanced claims management includes our efforts in digitization, automation and straight through processing, combined with the growing use of data analytics. A good example for this is the automated processing of cost estimates submitted by the body shops in case of a motor claim. Cost estimates are processed automatically and analytic service has been implemented to make the triage between straight through processing and individual reviews by an expert. Through machine learning we trained the service and achieve best results in detecting irregularities. We are more efficient and achieve a significant contribution to margin improvement. Next focus areas to further strengthen our excellent market position our fraud and the claims partner management.

I'm the chief customer officer at Helvetia Switzerland, and the chairman of the Board of Directors at MoneyPark. The key strategic thrust of Helvetia is to tap into new revenue sources, adjacent to its core insurance businesses in life and non-life. As a spearhead to develop a corporate ecosystem around customer needs related to privately owned property, Helvetia acquired a majority stake in MoneyPark back in 2016. I would like to hand over now to Stefan, who will give you more background to our joint strategic business. Stef an Heitmann Hello. My name is Stefan. And I'm the Founder and CEO of MoneyPark. And I have the pleasure to briefly share with you the very strong development of the last year as well as our vision for the future. As Martin just mentioned, since 2016, Helvetia is a majority owner of MoneyPark and MoneyPark is the anchor of the Helvetia Ecosystem Home. We fit together very well which benefits our customers, Helvetia's and MoneyPark's. We are closely interlinked in our core areas of expertise, mortgage advice, mortgage related pension planning and real estate. The year 2020 has shown that the ecosystem with MoneyPark as a strong anchor is already starting to prove itself very well. Despite COVID, it was MoneyPark's best business year yet. Last year, we brokered well over 3 billion mortgages from our over 150 different banking and mortgage providers, out of our 20 branches and together with our 300 plus colleagues. The fact, the demand for homeownership and the desire for house is such high, especially in the current situation has certainly helped us here. In 2020, we also took the next big step in our short history. We got directly into the business of supporting our clients in buying and selling real estate. Why? First, because the same values that guide us are still lacking in today's real estate market, transparency, independents convenience. And also because we have thousands of customers looking to buy and tens of thousands that we finance over the time, some of them will eventually want to sell as well. Therefore, we have created Switzerland's first big data platform currently unique in its kind. Compared to other offerings and platforms in the market, ours is by far the most developing comprehensive and we are constantly expanding it. We're currently unique in this market and our offer provides completely new type of real estate and mortgage brokerage services, helping customers from buying to owning into selling and price assessment of value development from searching to financing. Going forward, we want to become the number one choice for any customer in Switzerland, dreaming of their own house and we want to be the number one choice for our customers in terms of getting all the information and all the data, he or she may need to make his or her decisions. We want MoneyPark to become the information powerhouse in the Swiss real estate and banking market. And in doing so, we connect previously separated world to break down silos and the property owners' customer journey. Helvetia is a key partner for us in this journey. We see great potential going forward in this partnership. Many Helvetia customers deal with real estate, many of them have ownership issues and at some point have questions concerning their homes. And thanks to the cooperation between MoneyPark and Helvetia. They will soon receive independent advice also in this regard. This is what MoneyPark is all about.",   Hi my name is  I'm the chief customer  at Helvetia Switzerland and the chairman of the  of s at MoneyPark The key strategic thrust of Helvetia is to tap into new revenue sources adjacent to its core  es in life and non-life As a spearhead to develop a corporate ecosystem around customer needs related to privately owned property Helvetia acquired a majority stake in MoneyPark back in  I would like to hand over now to  who will give you more background to our joint strategic  Stef an  Hello My name is  And I'm the Foun and  of MoneyPark And I have the pleasure to briefly share with you the very strong development of the last year as well as our vision for the future As  just mentioned since  Helvetia is a majority owner of MoneyPark and MoneyPark is the anchor of the Helvetia Ecosystem Home We fit together very well which benefits our customers Helvetia's and MoneyPark's We are closely interlinked in our core areas of expertise mortgage advice mortgage related pension planning and real estate The year  has shown that the ecosystem with MoneyPark as a strong anchor is already sting to prove itself very well Despite COVID it was MoneyPark's best  year yet Last year we brokered well over  billion mortgages from our over  different banking and mortgage provis out of our  branches and together with our  plus colleagues The fact the demand for homeownership and the desire for house is such high especially in the current situation has certainly helped us here In  we also took the next big step in our short history We got directly into the  of supporting our cnts in buying and selling real estate Why?

2374,Stuart Beamish,20190404_Saga_PLC-_Earnings_Call_2019-4-4_DN000000002615981505.pdf,2019-04-04,623.0,1,0,Saga PLC-," 20609682  Thank you, Robin and good morning everyone. Just by way of introduction, I joined Saga just over two years ago and I have been in my current role just over a year. I joined from Barclaycard and prior to that had marketing roles in British Airways, BMI and Virgin. So from my perspective, it's been great joining another great British brand. And brand and membership is what I'm going to talk about today both in terms of current performance and also our plans, because both are key enablers to the Group strategy. What you will see over the coming slides are, ﬁrstly, that customer satisfaction and brand awareness are both strong points for the group. But the brand is not top of mind enough for consumers. And we're going to address this with a customer-focused strategy, focused on new products, advertising and membership. 18 months since launch, over 1 million customers have signed up to Possibilities our membership program. Engagement in the program is growing and we're starting to see a clear link between engagement and commercial value. And therefore in the coming year, we're going to be adding new beneﬁts to monetize the program. Company Name Saga PLC So turning ﬁrst to customer satisfaction. Last year, we introduced brand Net Promoter Score across Saga. As you'll be aware, this is an established industry measure for customer advocacy. Unlike transactional NPS, it focuses on the entire customer experience. So we feel this gives us the most robust measure we can have for customer satisfaction. We are very pleased with the initial results, as you can see from the chart on the screen, we have positive scores across the business. Cruise is the standout, but I'd like to talk for a moment about insurance. When you look across the insurance sector, it tends to score much lower than others, when it comes to NPS. So we think that our Insurance score currently actually screens very well against the rest of the market. When you consider that in both Travel and Insurance we are launching new products this year, we are conﬁdent these scores will grow. So in summary, when customers try Saga, they have a positive experience. But how eﬀective is our brand at attracting new customers in the ﬁrst place? Well, this is more of a mixed bag. Firstly, as you've heard already from Lance, brand awareness for Saga is exceptionally high. As you can see from the chart on the left, we now ask this question in relation to each of the sectors in which we operate and is high across the Board. However, when we look at brand consideration, the drop oﬀ from awareness is larger than we would like. This chart on the right shows Saga's prompted brand consideration compared to the average of our key competitors in each of the sectors in which we operate. So we've now embarked on a major program to improve brand consideration through a combination of new products, marketing and membership. You've already heard from Gary and Robin about new products, so I'm going to talk about advertising and then move on to membership. In terms of our advertising, it's fair to say that our marketing approach at Saga had become a little tired. We've had a narrow focus on direct marketing on one or two daily newspapers. But also the way we have presented the brand had led people to perceive us as old fashioned. So at the start of this year, we introduced a new communication strategy across the Group. Starting with Travel, as you can see from the example on the slide and the TV ads, that hopefully, you saw as you came in today. We've made a big change to the style of our communications. At the same time, we've also made the brand more visible using more digital media and both digital and broadcast TV. It's early days, but the -- so far, the results have been very encouraging. The chart on the right shows that already, after just one campaign, we're starting to tackle that old-fashioned perception with quite a signiﬁcant drop and that's just, as I said from the ﬁrst campaign. Also the audience comments that we've received are extremely positive. I've included some as an example on the slide. I particular like the ﬁrst and last comments because they point to this being unexpected from Saga. That's great evidence of starting to drive change in perception and that's going to help us push up those allimportant consideration scores. So based on these results, we're going to be rolling out this approach across our three-year ﬁxed-price Insurance campaign so that all of our activity across the group will work together to improve brand perception. I'd now like to turn to membership. So Possibilities was launched 18 months ago. We started oﬀ with some oﬀers, with some key brand partners, Apple, Majestic Wine and others and some free gifts, which we use to encourage members or customers to sign up. Company Name Saga PLC We have then added Dining Possibilities in October. This is our own Saga Dining program that gives customers discounts and oﬀers at over 1,100 UK branded restaurants. It's already one of the largest dining programs in the UK. And by creating our own scheme, we can tailor the proposition to our members and also collect usage data, which is very important for us for marketing. Last summer, we launched Travel Possibilities giving members access to deals with Saga Holidays, Titan, and Saga Cruises and this also gives us an excellent distribution channel for late availability. And last week, we launched Entertainment Possibilities in partnership with Ambassador Theatre Group, giving members exclusive oﬀers on theaters and shows. Since launch, we've also sourced over 300 events and balloted tickets for members to attend. These have included the likes of private gigs with Mica Paris, Lulu, Days at the Races, Audience With Style events and others. We've had over 400,000 ballot entries for members to attend those since launch. It's been one of most popular aspects of the program. So I'm now going to take three slides to talk through the results of membership since launch. So far, over 1 million customers have signed up, that's 84% on average of those asked. Now that's a high sign-up rate for any loyalty program, but also encouraging when you consider our objective to build brand aﬃnity to Saga. Over 90% of members have given positive consent to marketing. That compares to 73% for non-members at Saga. We've got over 200,000 additional marketing contacts for direct marketing through membership communications, that who -- otherwise we wouldn't have access to. But the number of members only really tells part of the story, because as with all loyalty programs, the commercial value is driven by members who engage with the beneﬁts of the program. So having successfully signed up many customers to membership, we are now keen to grow member engagement. The summary here is that as we are adding new beneﬁts, we're seeing membership grow. Firstly, as you can see from the chart on the left, membership is helping to lift Saga's overall marketing response rates, with email open rates far higher than industry standards and also Saga averages, these really are exceptional email engagement rates. We've also been tracking member usage of the program and we've seen that grow as we've added new beneﬁts, particularly since Dining Possibilities in October. We've clearly got some way to go in terms of engagement. But this is evidence that we've been adding the right beneﬁts for our members. We're also getting faster adding new features. As I said, we've just launched entertainment possibilities last week and a new global AccorHotels partnership is about to launch, and these should drive a further boost in engagement. As we grow membership numbers and usage of the program increases, we're keen to establish the link between Possibilities and commercial value. What we can see already is that members engaging most in Possibilities are slightly younger, have more product holdings with Saga, provide more contribution and are more likely to give marketing consent. So membership is already providing a stronger route to access our key Saga customers. Company Name Saga PLC In terms of multi-product holdings, the numbers we're looking at here refer to our core products only. That's insurance policies, holidays and cruises. The Group average for core products is 1.4 products per customer. That's 1.2 from non-members and 1.7 from engaged members. As usage grows, we recognize there is a need to better establish cause and eﬀect between membership and these numbers. But we expect increasing engagement in the program to lead to increasing commercial value. So the formula we are following for generating value for membership is this Firstly, signing up members. We're still doing so at a rate of 10,000 a week. Secondly, creating beneﬁts, which drive engagement. Thirdly, monetizing, both in terms of direct sales from products like Travel Possibilities and also indirectly leveraging the higher marketing engagement to inﬂuence purchase. In terms of the program itself, we will continue to develop the proposition to add new beneﬁts to provide value for our members. And in turn drive retention, multi-product holdings and travel contribution. We also believe that in the future membership can play an important role in driving new customer acquisition. In terms of what we're going to build? Well, 18 months on, we've got some clear insights in terms of what our members want from Saga. And this is going to be used to reﬁne and strengthen the program. Firstly, we are going to scale access to experiences by testing paid for events and that will enable us to open access to more members. Secondly, by creating online communities for our members to connect with each other, which members are already telling us is something, they're very interested in. And thirdly, to expand the level of incentives and customer recognition through Possibilities to support our commercial objectives. For example, to acknowledge a forthcoming renewal or incentivize additional product holdings. And all of this will be -- continue to be supported by third-party oﬀers from well-known, high quality brands in dining, retail, travel and entertainment. In terms of execution, but there's a lot of detail on here and I don't propose to talk to all of it, but we have a clear product roadmap for Possibilities over the coming 12 months to 18 months. I don't propose to go in detail but just to highlight a few things, the scaling events, expanding retention and cross-sell incentives and developing communities in sort of beat to launch this year. One other aspects to highlight is digital, two-thirds of the unique visits to Possibilities often tablets and phones, that's higher digital usage than we've seen from our customers previously. So we'll be investing to develop the digital experience to make easier for members to get value from the program. That will include a digital version of Saga Magazine and a new member app this year. Finally, in keeping with the executional focus, these are the core 12-month goals we've set for brand and membership. We're aiming to deliver growth back into brand consideration, double member engagement, grow the number of customers with multiproduct holdings and contribute to the goals already outlined for Travel proﬁtability and Insurance retention, all of which we hope to update you on going forward. Company Name Saga PLC Thank you. I'll now hand back to James.",   Thank you in and good morning everyone Just by way of introduction I joined Saga just over two years ago and I have been in my current role just over a year I joined from Barclaycard and prior to that had marketing roles in British Airways BMI and Virgin So from my perspective it's been great joining another great British brand And brand and membership is what I'm going to talk about today both in terms of current performance and also our plans because both are key enablers to the   What you will see over the coming slides are ﬁrstly that customer satisfaction and brand awareness are both strong points for the  But the brand is not top of mind enough for consumers And we're going to address this with a customer-focused  focused on new products advertising and membership  months since launch over  million customers have signed up to Possibilities our membership program Engagement in the program is growing and we're sting to see a clear link between engagement and  value And therefore in the coming year we're going to be adding new beneﬁts to monetize the program  Name Saga PLC So turning ﬁrst to customer satisfaction Last year we introduced brand Net Promoter Score across Saga As you'll be aware this is an established industry measure for customer advocacy Unlike transactional NPS it focuses on the entire customer experience So we feel this gives us the most robust measure we can have for customer satisfaction We are very pleased with the initial results as you can see from the ch on the screen we have positive scores across the  Cruise is the standout but I'd like to talk for a moment about  When you look across the  sector it tends to score much lower than others when it comes to NPS So we think that our  score currently actually screens very well against the rest of the market When you consi that in both Travel and  we are launching new products this year we are conﬁt these scores will grow So in summary when customers try Saga they have a positive experience But how eﬀective is our brand at attracting new customers in the ﬁrst place? Well this is more of a mixed bag Firstly as you've heard already from  brand awareness for Saga is exceptionally high As you can see from the ch on the left we now ask this question in relation to each of the sectors in which we operate and is high across the  However when we look at brand consiation the drop oﬀ from awareness is larger than we would like This ch on the right shows Saga's prompted brand consiation compared to the average of our key competitors in each of the sectors in which we operate So we've now embarked on a major program to improve brand consiation through a combination of new products marketing and membership You've already heard from  and in about new products so I'm going to talk about advertising and then move on to membership In terms of our advertising it's fair to say that our marketing approach at Saga had become a little tired We've had a narrow focus on direct marketing on one or two daily newspapers But also the way we have presented the brand had led people to perceive us as old fashioned So at the st of this year we introduced a new communication  across the  Sting with Travel as you can see from the example on the slide and the TV ads that hopefully you saw as you came in today We've made a big change to the style of our communications At the same time we've also made the brand more visible using more digital media and both digital and broadcast TV It's early days but the -- so far the results have been very encouraging The ch on the right shows that already after just one campaign we're sting to tackle that old-fashioned perception with quite a signiﬁcant drop and that's just as I said from the ﬁrst campaign Also the audience comments that we've received are extremely positive I've included some as an example on the slide I picular like the ﬁrst and last comments because they point to this being unexpected from Saga That's great evice of sting to drive change in perception and that's going to help us push up those allimportant consiation scores So based on these results we're going to be rolling out this approach across our three-year ﬁxed-pe  campaign so that all of our activity across the  will work together to improve brand perception I'd now like to turn to membership So Possibilities was launched  months ago We sted oﬀ with some oﬀers with some key brand pners Apple Majestic Wine and others and some free gifts which we use to encourage members or customers to sign up  Name Saga PLC We have then added Dining Possibilities in October This is our own Saga Dining program that gives customers discounts and oﬀers at over  UK branded restaurants It's already one of the largest dining programs in the UK And by creating our own scheme we can tailor the proposition to our members and also collect usage data which is very important for us for marketing Last summer we launched Travel Possibilities giving members access to deals with Saga Holidays Titan and Saga Cruises and this also gives us an excellent distribution channel for late availability And last week we launched Entertainment Possibilities in  with Ambassador Theatre  giving members exclusive oﬀers on theaters and shows Since launch we've also sourced over  events and balloted tickets for members to attend These have included the likes of private gigs with Mica  Lulu s at the Races Audience h Style events and others We've had over  ballot entries for members to attend those since launch It's been one of most popular aspects of the program So I'm now going to take three slides to talk through the results of membership since launch So far over  million customers have signed up that's % on average of those asked Now that's a high sign-up rate for any loyalty program but also encouraging when you consi our objective to build brand aﬃnity to Saga Over % of members have given positive consent to marketing That compares to % for non-members at Saga We've got over  additional marketing contacts for direct marketing through membership communications that who -- otherwise we wouldn't have access to But the number of members only really tells p of the story because as with all loyalty programs the  value is driven by members who engage with the beneﬁts of the program So having successfully signed up many customers to membership we are now keen to grow member engagement The summary here is

Now, after all those details regarding the ﬁnancial performance in 2016, I would now like to come to the last part of our presentation and give you an update on our strategy. We will start on slide number 22. One year ago, in March 2016, we announced our new Helvetia 2020 strategy. The new strategy makes us ﬁt for the future. Ladies and gentlemen, you already know these slides. But, once again, ﬁt means that our product oﬀerings and sales channels are becoming more innovative and increasingly digital. And we, as an organization, become more agile and eﬃcient. By combining our strength with new opportunities, we want to focus even more intensely on the needs of our customers. With that, I would like to move on to slide 23. Over the past months, we have been ﬁnetuning the details for implementing the Helvetia 2020 strategy. The implementation is based on our vision of being the leading Swiss all-lines insurer with a national and an international ambition, digital and innovative. And with a highly developed customer focus. Together with our objectives of accelerating proﬁtable growth, enhancing eﬃciency. And delivering quality, as well as with our ﬁnancial targets, this forms the basis for the implementation framework. I will continue on slide 24. As you can see on this slide, the new framework comprises 16 Group-wide strategic initiatives and ensures a consistent and well-managed implementation of Helvetia 2020. Every initiative is sponsored by a member of the senior management. All initiatives have been designed to accelerate proﬁtable growth, enhance eﬃciency. And deliver quality. Company Name Helvetia Holding AG 16 initiatives, of course, sounds like a lot. To obtain a holistic view, however, we also included internal initiatives that form the basis for the successful strategy implementation. For instance, future oriented IT systems, or an executive CRM. Other initiatives, such as value-creating capital management, or strong international positioning, are not new for us. And we have been constantly working on these topics in any case. Due to their strategic importance for the entire Group, however, they have been included in the framework as well. I will now move to slide 25. Over the past months, we have already been working with the framework, as well as starting our initiatives. And, therefore, we already achieved important milestones in various areas. Within the next minutes, I am happy to provide you with some insight regarding selected initiatives; those on which I want to take a closer look at are shaded in green. In December 2016, Helvetia successfully concluded Project ONE. The project focused on combining the Group and the market unit Switzerland functions, deﬁning an (adecrete) organizational structure. And nominating the relevant functional Executives. Vacancies in the newly created Executive management area of non-life Switzerland and IT, as well as in the new support function corporate development, have already been successfully ﬁlled. The new structure has been operative since January 1, 2017. Both the Board of Directors and the Executive management furthermore focused on designing an implementation framework for Helvetia 2020, as just discussed on the previous slide. Project ONE also looked at individual issues, such as the future growth strategy of the direct insurer, smile.direct. I will give you more details on that on the following slides. Turning to slide 27, in Switzerland, we are very well positioned. Helvetia is already able to serve all customer segments pure direct customers, hybrid customers. And traditional oﬄine customers. With smile.direct, Helvetia has the only direct insurer in Switzerland that is already very well established on the market and repeatedly achieves top results in terms of quality, service. And quotes in independent comparison tests. According to our own estimates, smile.direct has a market share of 22% of the Swiss online market. Company Name Helvetia Holding AG Please have a look at the following short ﬁlm, it shows how smile.direct is working and aiming to enhance its services. (video playing) Okay. With a smile, I would like to turn on to slide 28. Ladies and gentlemen, as you have just seen, smile.direct is already well positioned in the Swiss market. And continues to make very good progress. This is the reason why we aim to further expand and strengthen its product portfolio. The ambition of smile.direct is to deliver the greatest possible beneﬁt to its customers. In order to achieve this, the Company will, according to its new strategy, realize, step by step, new innovations, based on the customers' needs and their feedback. An example could be on-demand insurance. smile.direct also intends to oﬀer new products that can be easily bought online, as, for instance, a pure risk life insurance, or a building insurance in the non-life area. smile.direct will, of course, take advantage of Helvetia's product know-how. With innovations and new products, smile.direct is fostering the proﬁtable growth of its core business. By successfully developing new partnerships, smile.direct intends to tap into new business areas and to exploit new distribution channels. This might include partnerships with other industries, such as car dealers or in the retail sector. The goal is to expand both the product oﬀering and the customer reach. Finally, within its new strategy, smile.direct wants to develop new customer segments. Families with a high online aﬃnity, for instance, are in the ideal new customer group with a perfect ﬁt to the smile brand, oﬀerings. And services. smile.direct aims to position itself as a professional advisor for the day-to-day family life and, therefore, build up the eco system, smile family, as a second foot hold. Let us now move to slide 29. In order to further providing our customers with ﬁrst-class customer interaction and experience, one of the key pillars of our strategy is to systematically transform our business model. We are, therefore, putting emphasis on the following three key topics, ﬁrst, development of eco systems; second, corporate venturing; and third, development of own business models through an in-house incubator. We deﬁne eco systems as an interaction, a network, or a cooperation between diﬀerent suppliers of solutions, service providers. And customers around a particular topic, such as home. The partners participating in an eco system will proﬁt from gaining access to customers, while the customers themselves will beneﬁt from a continuous and excellent customer journey. Company Name Helvetia Holding AG Helvetia aims to achieve a leading position in building up a home eco system. By acquiring 70% of MoneyPark, the largest and most advanced technology based mortgage intermediary in Switzerland, we set forth a strong anchor in building our eco system home. With MoneyPark, we are adding a new independent business model to our current portfolio. This oﬀers us not only the possibility of tapping into new sources of revenue. But also opens up access to new customers and a broader range of products. With corporate venturing and corporate incubation, we will be taking advantage of the opportunities from targeted business model innovation, giving us the opportunity to capture new value from the market. We have launched the Helvetia venture fund, at the beginning of 2017. The fund invests in start-ups which can contribute to the digital transformation of Helvetia's existing core business. We will invest around CHF55 million, in approximately 25 young companies, over the next ﬁve years. Helvetia aims for an operational cooperation with the start-ups we are investing in. We are working together with b-to-v Partners in the venture capital sector. The Helvetia venture fund will, thus, beneﬁt from the start-up (yield) ﬂow and the experience of b-to-v. Any investment decision, however, will remain with us. This allows for the necessary agility, lean processes. And quick decisions for all investments. Finally, we are also putting emphasis on the development and the implementation of own business innovations through our in-house incubators. With slide number 30, I would like to provide you with more details on our strategic initiative comprehensive customer access. The objective of this initiative is to enable Helvetia to achieve above-market growth through relevant customer channels in the proﬁtable private and corporate customer segments by opening new and expanding existing channels. In this context, Helvetia has initiated measures to promote SME business in Switzerland. The non-life market in Switzerland is reasonably saturated. Nevertheless, due to our own market position, our distribution capabilities. And our products, we consider the SME business to be a market segment that still oﬀers attractive growth opportunities. Helvetia has, thus, launched a new insurance package especially for SME customers, including redesigned and simpliﬁed product coverages, which are now much more Company Name Helvetia Holding AG convenient and relevant for our customers, as well as for our distribution partners. With that, Helvetia is getting closer to the market leader in this segment. In addition, the new SME product also includes attractive adaptations with regard to specialty lines components, such as technical insurance and cyber insurance. This enables us to make use of our dedicated know-how in providing specialty lines coverage at the point of sale also for our SME customers and, thus, diﬀerentiates ourselves from our competitors. Another strategic business area we want to push further is the mortgage business; we, therefore, launched a new sales initiative for our own tied agents. Helvetia has been successfully providing mortgages for selected customer segments for many years. A unique value proposition for our customers is the overall risk assessment, combining with ﬁnancial planning and insurance advice for pension solutions, building, household. And liability insurance. Mortgages do not only oﬀer considerable growth potential, they are also an important element of our home eco system. Furthermore, in this low interest rate environment, mortgages will generally remain an interesting asset class for insurance companies. Especially when providing long-term mortgages, insurance companies do not have to hedge interest rate risks, due to the long duration of the liabilities, providing a ﬁnancial advantage compared to banks. With the development of new online models, we are expanding our digital products and service range, thus, responding to the needs of the growing share of online aﬄuent customers by making their customer experience more convenient. In Germany, for instance, only a few clicks are needed to buy a Helvetia insurance policy by digital means. All products have a modular design in order to deliver greatest possible beneﬁt to the customers. Payment is easily arranged with PayPal, the most popular online payment service provider today. This is a service that has not been oﬀered by any other insurance company in Germany so far. With these products, Helvetia Germany has been a ﬁrst mover when it comes to a full digital insurance solution. In Spain, ﬁnally, Helvetia insurance, in collaboration with Telefonica, launched the mobile application, Helvetia Good Driver. Through this new app, our Spanish customers can learn about their driving habits. And how to improve them; gamiﬁcation of insurance-related behavior. Both the Helvetia Good Driver app, as well as the My Helvetia app, that oﬀers registered customers the possibility to consult personal data, agents' data, policies, receipts. And claims data, were very recently nominated among the best insurance apps in Spain. Company Name Helvetia Holding AG Let me now move to slide 31. Ladies and gentlemen, a lot has happened in the 2016 ﬁnancial year. We are driving forward the implementation of our strategy; and I am proud of what we have already initiated, not least thanks to the strong commitment of our employees. Helvetia is well position and, therefore, I am certain that we also -- that we will also be able to report on many interesting achievements on our Capital Markets Day, on June 8, 2017, here in Zurich. You are already cordially invited to join us for that event. This brings us to the end of the presentation. My colleagues and I would now be pleased to answer your questions.

product oﬀerings and sales channels are becoming more innovative and increasingly digital And we as an organization become more agile and eﬃcient By combining our strength with new opporties we want to focus even more intensely on the needs of our customers h that I would like to move on to slide  Over the past months we have been ﬁnetuning the details for implementing the Helvetia   The implementation is based on our vision of being the leading Swiss all-s insurer with a national and an international ambition digital and innovative And with a highly developed customer focus Together with our objectives of accelerating proﬁtable growth enhancing eﬃciency And ivering quality as well as with our ﬁnancial targets this forms the basis for the implementation framework I will continue on slide  As you can see on this slide the new framework comprises  -wide strategic initiatives and ensures a consistent and well-d implementation of Helvetia  Every initiative is ssored by a member of the senior  All initiatives have been designed to accelerate proﬁtable growth enhance eﬃciency And iver quality  Name Helvetia Holding AG  initiatives of course sounds like a lot To obtain a holistic view however we also included internal initiatives that form the basis for the successful  implementation For instance future oriented IT systems or an  CRM Other initiatives such as value-creating capital  or strong international positioning are not new for us And we have been constantly working on these topics in any case Due to their strategic importance for the entire  however they have been included in the framework as well I will now move to slide  Over the past months we have already been working with the framework as well as sting our initiatives And therefore we already achieved important milestones in various areas hin the next minutes I am happy to provide you with some insight regarding selected initiatives; those on which I want to take a closer look at are shaded in green In December  Helvetia successfully concluded Project ONE The project focused on combining the  and the market  Switzerland functions deﬁning an adecrete organizational structure And nominating the relet functional s Vacancies in the newly created   area of non-life Switzerland and IT as well as in the new support function corporate development have already been successfully ﬁlled The new structure has been operative since uary   Both the  of s and the   furthermore focused on designing an implementation framework for Helvetia  as just discussed on the previous slide Project ONE also looked at individual issues such as the future growth  of the direct insurer smiledirect I will give you more details on that on the following slides Turning to slide  in Switzerland we are very well positioned Helvetia is already able to serve all customer segments pure direct customers hybrid customers And traditional oﬄine customers h smiledirect Helvetia has the only direct insurer in Switzerland that is already very well established on the market and repeatedly achieves top results in terms of quality service And quotes in indepent comparison tests According to our own estimates smiledirect has a market share of % of the Swiss on market  Name Helvetia Holding AG Please have a look at the following short ﬁlm it shows how smiledirect is working and aiming to enhance its services video playing Okay h a smile I would like to turn on to slide  Ladies and gentlemen as you have just seen smiledirect is already well positioned in the Swiss market And continues to make very good progress This is the reason why we aim to further expand and strengthen its product portfolio The ambition of smiledirect is to iver the greatest possible beneﬁt to its customers In or to achieve this the  will according to its new  realize step by step new innovations based on the customers' needs and their feedback An example could be on-demand  smiledirect also intends to oﬀer new products that can be easily bought on as for instance a pure  life  or a building  in the non-life area smiledirect will of course take adtage of Helvetia's product know-how h innovations and new products smiledirect is fostering the proﬁtable growth of its core  By successfully developing new s smiledirect intends to tap into new  areas and to exploit new distribution channels This might include s with other industries such as car dealers or in the retail sector The goal is to expand both the product oﬀering and the customer reach Finally within its new  smiledirect wants to develop new customer segments Famis with a high on aﬃnity for instance are in the ideal new customer  with a perfect ﬁt to the smile brand oﬀerings And services smiledirect aims to position itself as a professional advisor for the day-to-day family life and therefore build up the eco system smile family as a second foot hold Let us now move to slide  In or to further providing our customers with ﬁrst-class customer interaction and experience one of the key pillars of our  is to systematically transform our  mo We are therefore putting emphasis on the following three key topics ﬁrst development of eco systems; second corporate venturing; and third development of own  mos through an in-house incubator We deﬁne eco systems as an interaction a network or a cooperation between diﬀerent supprs of solutions service provis And customers around a picular topic such as home The pners picipating in an eco system will proﬁt from gaining access to customers while the customers themselves will beneﬁt from a continuous and excellent customer journey  Name Helvetia Holding AG Helvetia aims to achieve a leading position in building up a home eco system By acquiring % of MoneyPark the largest and most adced technology based mortgage intermediary in Switzerland we set forth a strong anchor in building our eco system home h MoneyPark we are adding a new indepent  mo to our current portfolio This oﬀers us not only the possibility of tapping into new sources of revenue But also opens up access to new customers and a broa range of products h corporate venturing and corporate incubation we will be taking adtage of the opporties from targeted  mo innovation giving us the opporty to capture new value from the market We have launched the Helvetia venture fund at the beginning of  The fund invests in st-ups which can contribute to the digital transformation of Helvetia's existing core  We will invest around CHF million in approximately  young companies over the next ﬁve years Helvetia aims for an operational cooperation with the st-ups we are investing in We are working together with b-to-v  in the venture capital sector The Helvetia venture fund will thus beneﬁt from the st-up yield ﬂow and the experience of b-to-v Any  decision however will remain with us This allows for the necessary agility lean processes And quick decisions for all s Finally we are also putting emphasis on the development and the implementation of own  innovations through our in-house incubators h slide number  I would like to provide you with more details on our strategic initiative comprehensive customer access The objective of this initiative is to enable Helvetia to achieve above-market growth through relet customer channels in the proﬁtable private and corporate customer segments by opening new and expanding existing channels In this context Helvetia has initiated measures to promote SME  in Switzerland The non-life market in Switzerland is reasonably saturated Nevertheless due to our own market position our distribution capabilities And our products we consi the SME  to be a market segment that still oﬀers attractive growth opporties Helvetia has thus launched a new  package especially for SME customers including redesigned and simpliﬁed product coverages which are now much more  Name Helvetia Holding AG convenient and relet for our customers as well as for our distribution pners h that Helvetia is getting closer to the market lea in this segment In addition the new SME product also includes attractive adaptations with regard to specialty s coments such as technical  and cyber  This enables us to make use of our dedicated know-how in providing specialty s coverage at the point of sale also for our SME customers and thus diﬀerentiates ourselves from our competitors Another strategic  area we want to push further is the mortgage ; we therefore launched a new sales initiative for our own tied agents Helvetia has been successfully providing mortgages for selected customer segments for many years A unique value proposition for our customers is the overall  assessment combining with ﬁnancial planning and  advice for pension solutions building household And liability  Mortgages do not only oﬀer consiable growth potential they are also an important element of our home eco system Furthermore in this low interest rate environment mortgages will generally remain an interesting asset class for  companies Especially when providing long-term mortgages  companies do not have to hedge interest rate s due to the long duration of the liabilities providing a ﬁnancial adtage compared to banks h the development of new on mos we are expanding our digital products and service range thus resding to the needs of the growing share of on aﬄuent customers by making their customer experience more convenient In y for instance only a few clicks are needed to buy a Helvetia  policy by digital means All products have a modular design in or to iver greatest possible beneﬁt to the customers Payment is easily arranged with PayPal the most popular on payment service provi today This is a service that has not been oﬀered by any other  company in y so far h these products Helvetia y has been a ﬁrst mover when it comes to a full digital  solution In Spain ﬁnally Helvetia  in collaboration with Telefonica launched the mobile application Helvetia Good Driver Through this new app our Spanish customers can learn about their driving habits And how to improve them; gamiﬁcation of -related behavior Both the Helvetia Good Driver app as well as the My Helvetia app that oﬀers registered customers the possibility to consult personal data agents' data policies receipts And claims data were very recently nominated among the best  apps in Spain  Name Helvetia Holding AG Let me now move to slide  Ladies and gentlemen a lot has happened in the  ﬁnancial year We are driving forward the implementation of our ; and I am proud
