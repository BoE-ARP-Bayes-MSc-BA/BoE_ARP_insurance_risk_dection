I think a little bit more context I can provide there. Within the quarter itself, so Q2-over-Q2, yes, we did talk about pools did impact the current accident year by a 1 point. But pools also favorably impacted the PYD for a 1 point. So if you're looking in aggregate in particular in the quarter, pools had zero impact in totality in Q2. Now, when we look year-to-date, pools are actually favorably impacting our combined ratio by roughly 0.6 points which is very much in line with our long-term expectations. We're going to see -- as we have seen in the past, we're going to see some noise from quarter-to-quarter. We're going to see noise between current accident year and prior accident years that will continue. Obviously, there's an element of the pools as you talk about the assumed element that we're not reserving that, that's coming from the industry. So we do tend to get a little bit of noise.

Why don't I ask Darren to shed a bit of light on that frequency and severity bumps in the quarter and maybe then rate direction? Darren Godf rey  19791482  Sure. Absolutely. Thanks, Charles. So from a frequency standpoint in the quarter, largely driven by two weather events, a snow event in April in Ontario followed by a similar event, in the May long weekend in Alberta. Both of those drove frequency higher. If we were to exclude those two particular events, frequency was actually relatively flat in the quarter when comparing Q2 of 2016 back to Q2 of 2015. In terms of the severity itself, there's a couple of things that play there. One is actually tied back to the increase in frequency that I just talked about. So due to the increase in frequency in Alberta and Ontario, there was a change in mix, change in the number of claims by province. Obviously, Alberta and Ontario tend to have a higher severity due to the product features in the order of products in those two provinces. So as we got more claims in those two provinces, that drove then the national severity higher as well. We also experienced a bit of a blip in the Atlantic from a severity standpoint. Again, some context here obviously. As you're going to remember, back in Q2 of 2015, we were still experiencing the tough winter in the Atlantic, which drove an exceptional increase in claims being reported, but small event  2134  claims. So that essentially drove the lowest severity back in Q2 of 2015. Now as we look into Q2 of 2016, we're back in more of a normal pattern, consistent with our five-year average, so that's actually driving an increase in severity in the Atlantic. So it really is the Atlantic impact, but also a change in the mix between Alberta, Ontario and the other provinces in the country.",   Yeah Why don't I ask  to shed a bit of light on that frequency and severity bumps in the quer and maybe then rate direction?

So, yes, we operate in that sense. Also the next couple of years could be particularly interesting. We don't know yet, but there might be an opportunity once the FCA reform is implemented and prices in the market go up. So we might need to be ready to take volume very quickly. And also I think the fact that we have done a very strong move to digital and we have very strong systems and team makes it easier for us in the future to take more growth. Moving on to the trends in household in terms of claims, well, in terms of frequency, we saw a reduction in claims frequency in the early lockdown, but after the lockdown it was recovered and it went back to much more normal levels. In terms of severity, what we have seen is basically a change in trends mix. So more accidental damage, although small, reduced theft claims clearly as people have stayed more at home and then severity around escape of water has also been reduced and we think that might continue in the future. So it's clear that as people are allowed to go out more and to travel, we might see claims going back to previous patterns. But we think some of these changes that COVID has brought in terms of spending more time at home will continue in the future. So our expectation for 2021 is similar to 2020, but less strong COVID impact. In terms of weather, 2020 had a bit of a bad weather. Especially at the beginning of the year, we had a few storms cost in Admiral actually 5 million, but this year so far the weather has been quite benign.

So, just a little to unpack the adverse prior development we saw in the quarter, as we have mentioned in past quarters, we tend to get a little bit of noise from quarter-toquarter from pools. Q2 of 2016 and 2017 were two such quarters in particular with prior year developments. So as Louis mentioned, pools contributed 1.6 of the 4.2 points of deterioration in the PYD quarter-over-quarter. So, with respect to the quarter itself, when we look at it before pools, we saw unfavorable PYD of just shy of 2 points, 1. 8 points in particular, and this was largely driven through deterioration in Ontario accident benefit large losses. These were mostly on older accident years, in particular 2013, 2014, stemming from the combining of psychological increase on top of physical injuries. So, this is what we call the stacking effect. It was addressed, as Patrick mentioned, with the change in the definition in June of 2016 in those reforms, but only obviously for new claims beyond June 1, 2016. So, definitely, we saw some pressure there from the nature of those IB  2513  claims, which the reforms are now addressing.

We have clearly gotten some claim volume out of that. It hasn't been outsized. It was obviously contemplated in what we booked in the quarter. The -- a couple of comments, from an auto perspective, at least up here in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and the northeast, they really shut down the roads a lot. So there wasn't a lot of activity.

So overall, the underlying loss ratio deteriorated by a few points versus year-on-year last year. It's driven basically by two elements. There's a little bit more large losses on a national basis, all of them mostly concentrated out West. We also saw an increase in severity. And the severity increase is driven pretty much by ﬁre losses. We had more ﬁre losses. Although the severity was stable, the mix between liability and ﬁre losses changed, and the severity of ﬁre losses are much higher than any severity of liability, the severity of enlarged – in ﬁre are both six times what we normally see our liability, which are smaller cases. So clearly, the fact that we have more ﬁre, more increase on the ﬁre side as Company Name Intact Financial Corp translated into deterioration. And that relates to what Charles was saying because we have diﬀerent quarters, and the situation from quarter-to-quarter has been very diﬀerent. Last year was pretty much cat driven issue. The ﬁrst quarter was more related to weather losses as well as some large losses, but more water damage. And this quarter, it's much more out West ﬁre losses that are being aﬀected. So we don't see a common pattern or something emerging out in every quarter. But in spite that, it's still ﬁve quarter in a row that we're disappointed with the results, that's why we're taking the current corrective action.",   Yes So overall the unlying loss ratio deteriorated by a few points versus year-on-year last year It's driven basically by two elements There's a little bit more large losses on a national basis all of them mostly concentrated out t We also saw an increase in severity And the severity increase is driven pretty much by ﬁre losses We had more ﬁre losses Although the severity was stable the mix between liability and ﬁre losses changed and the severity of ﬁre losses are much higher than any severity of liability the severity of enlarged – in ﬁre are both six times what we normally see our liability which are smaller cases So clearly the fact that we have more ﬁre more increase on the ﬁre side as  Name Intact  p translated into deterioration And that relates to what  was saying because we have diﬀerent quers and the situation from quer-to-quer has been very diﬀerent Last year was pretty much cat driven issue The ﬁrst quer was more related to weather losses as well as some large losses but more water damage And this quer it's much more out t ﬁre losses that are being aﬀected So we don't see a common pattern or something emerging out in every quer But in spite that it's still ﬁve quer in a row that we're disappointed with the results that's why we're taking the current corrective action,loss ratio point year year year element bit loss basis t increase severity severity increase loss ﬁre loss severity mix liability loss severity loss severity liability severity ﬁre time liability case fact ﬁre increase side deterioration diﬀerent quer situation quer quer diﬀerent year cat issue quer weather loss loss water damage t loss pattern quer spite ﬁve quer row result action,"['severity', 'severity', 'ﬁre', 'severity', 'severity', 'severity', 'severity', 'ﬁre', 'ﬁre', 'deterioration', 'weather', 'water', 'damage', 'pattern', 'spite', 'ﬁve', 'row']",58,318,16,5.482758620689655,3.625,17,0.0033862754,0.00479071,0.009833747,0.006032366,0.0022191473,0.0033573182,0.0050233863,0.0050609,0.005245286,0.057876144,0.056224983,0.0067421943,0.0060104583,0.0036251806,0.007332811,0.003634879,0.7661966,0.008370431,0.0059365486,0.002633492,0.0056170817,0.0041579767,0.0006218673,0.0047001243,0.003845424,0.0048694303,0.0066552185,topic_17

I think that if you look at 2011, if you look at the results, it's to a large degree affected by weather-related claims we have in the Nordic region within our weather in the Nordic region rather strongly between the First Quarters. Then we had some  slopes  in the Norwegian segment in June in 2011. We had the heavy rainstorm in the  martinum  in July and we also had the storms in the Fourth Quarter in Norway. So it is a response to a large degree affected by weather-related claims and it is not easy to operate -- to estimate the effect on all future weather-related claims. But if you look at the large losses -- in this slide, on the large losses, we have tried to now include also weather-related large losses in the expected levels of large losses, and it has been from around 3.5% to now 4.8%. But of course, some large losses and weather-related losses, expect it to affect our -- the combined ratio, it's 4.8%. It is, of course, nothing that you -- you have to look at it in a longer perspective and not so much   ; multiple speakers .",   Hello I will give some comment to the results I think that if you look at  if you look at the results it's to a large degree affected by weather-related claims we have in the Nordic region within our weather in the Nordic region rather strongly between the First Quers Then we had some  slopes  in the Norwegian segment in e in  We had the heavy rainstorm in the  minum  in July and we also had the storms in the Fourth Quer in Norway So it is a resse to a large degree affected by weather-related claims and it is not easy to operate -- to estimate the effect on all future weather-related claims But if you look at the large losses -- in this slide on the large losses we have tried to now include also weather-related large losses in the expected levels of large losses and it has been from around % to now % But of course some large losses and weather-related losses expect it to affect our -- the combined ratio it's % It is of course nothing that you -- you have to look at it in a longer perspective and not so much   ; multiple speakers ,comment result result degree weather claim region weather region slope segment e rainstorm minum storm resse degree weather claim effect weather claim loss slide loss weather loss level loss % % course loss weather loss ratio % course perspective speaker,"['degree', 'weather', 'region', 'weather', 'region', 'slope', 'rainstorm', 'minum', 'storm', 'resse', 'degree', 'weather', 'weather', 'weather', 'weather', 'speaker']",33,193,13,5.848484848484849,2.5384615384615383,16,0.05703118,0.00504684,0.010359497,0.006354879,0.0023377915,0.0035368134,0.05875582,0.0053314753,0.0055257194,0.0075065647,0.005767125,0.007102658,0.006331801,0.0038189967,0.0077248514,0.0038292136,0.75369656,0.008817947,0.006253939,0.0027742886,0.0059173927,0.0043802783,0.00065511477,0.004951411,0.0040510152,0.005129769,0.007011032,topic_17
