So, I mean, generally, what I would say on the U.S. mortality, it's – there is a general trend to increasing longevity that's still there. But what we've had to adjust back is that that increase in longevity is not as much as what we had predicted it would be. You have to go back into – if I go back a little bit into why the data is just really starting to emerge, you really get back into older age state planning, second-to-die spouse products and things like that. These are the products that really extend out into these older ages and they were popular in the 1980s and 1990s as when those products started being sold to people in their 50s and 60s. So, that's the cohort of people that are now in the 85 to 95 area that are coming on line now that's giving us the data points that we're seeing. So, we've had to pull back our assumption. And again, I will repeat what I've said before. I've seen pricing benchmark data from the U.S. that suggests this is not ours alone. But we see a trend and it's important. We still sell these products. And we're still very much committed to this part of the market. So, it's important that we acknowledge and address the trends when we see them, so we can get our pricing assumptions updated and make sure that we don't grow into this problem into the future. So, that's I think the importance for us to deal with this now. I think you're going to see a good continued emerging experience as the data comes on line. There was a recent – going back a year or so, an old age mortality study performed in the industry that really did start to correlate with our own data, which is giving us the confidence to make this assumption change. I'm not sure I can add a whole lot more. I really don't want to comment on competitors or other experience or how you've been hearing that from others. I don't think that's my place to do here.",   Yeah So I mean generally what I would say on the US mortality it's – there is a general trend to increasing longevity that's still there But what we've had to adjust back is that that increase in longevity is not as much as what we had predicted it would be You have to go back into – if I go back a little bit into why the data is just really sting to emerge you really get back into ol age state planning second-to-die spouse products and things like that These are the products that really extend out into these ol ages and they were popular in the s and s as when those products sted being sold to people in their s and s So that's the cohort of people that are now in the  to  area that are coming on  now that's giving us the data points that we're seeing So we've had to pull back our assumption And again I will repeat what I've said before I've seen ping benchmark data from the US that suggests this is not ours alone But we see a trend and it's important We still sell these products And we're still very much committed to this p of the market So it's important that we acknowledge and address the trends when we see them so we can get our ping assumptions updated and make sure that we don't grow into this problem into the future So that's I think the importance for us to deal with this now I think you're going to see a good continued emerging experience as the data comes on  There was a recent – going back a year or so an old age mortality study performed in the industry that really did st to correlate with our own data which is giving us the confice to make this assumption change I'm not sure I can add a whole lot more I really don't want to comment on competitors or other experience or how you've been hearing that from others I don't think that's my place to do here,mortality trend longevity increase longevity bit datum age state planning die spouse product thing product age product people s cohort people area datum assumption ping datum trend product p market trend ping assumption problem future importance experience data year age mortality study industry datum confice assumption change lot competitor experience other place,"['mortality', 'longevity', 'longevity', 'age', 'state', 'planning', 'die', 'spouse', 'age', 'cohort', 'problem', 'age', 'mortality', 'study', 'confice']",48,298,24,6.208333333333333,2.0,15,0.003768814,0.0053319037,0.010944639,0.006713826,0.0024698386,0.0037365856,0.005590865,0.0056326166,0.0058378326,0.007930563,0.0060928734,0.0075038425,0.006689444,0.004034708,0.00816118,0.004045502,0.0054963813,0.009316017,0.0066071847,0.002930991,0.006251629,0.0046276925,0.0006921181,0.06171478,0.7385679,0.0054195174,0.06389074,topic_25

I think on the legal dispute, if I – this is Filip Coremans again, I may say. We have disclosed I think a fair amount of information today. I don't think we should go, the interest also of our shareholders and our company in much more detail at this moment. Let it be said that it is clear that this – though we have been convicted, the claimants still have to go through individual procedures, and this may take up – one to two years to come up with any quantification on these claims. So, it is a period, a process that will take some time. And so, at this moment, we stick to the factual reading of what you can see in the arrest  5529  on which we base as we don't speculate on any long or short of periods. I think this is what it is.",   Yeah I think on the legal dispute if I – this is  emans again I may say We have disclosed I think a fair amount of information today I don't think we should go the interest also of our sharehols and our company in much more detail at this moment Let it be said that it is clear that this – though we have been convicted the claimants still have to go through individual procedures and this may take up – one to two years to come up with any quantification on these claims So it is a period a process that will take some time And so at this moment we stick to the factual reading of what you can see in the arrest    on which we base as we don't speculate on any long or short of periods I think this is what it is,dispute eman amount information today interest sharehol company detail moment claimant procedure year quantification claim period process time moment reading arrest period,"['dispute', 'eman', 'claimant', 'procedure', 'quantification', 'read', 'arrest']",18,116,9,6.444444444444445,2.0,7,0.006875762,0.009727436,0.019967217,0.012248592,0.0045059323,0.0068169646,0.010199881,0.010276052,0.010650444,0.014468387,0.011115736,0.013689885,0.012204111,0.0073608537,0.01488912,0.007380546,0.010027506,0.016995985,0.012054037,0.005347251,0.011405367,0.008442685,0.0012626887,0.009543504,0.7291435,0.009887277,0.013513282,topic_25

Firstly is, just coming back on the mortality and long-term care losses in the U.S. that have appeared in Q2, I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on those. And do you expect the rate increases you're filing to basically fix that problem? Then, secondly, just very quickly, just wondered what's your thoughts on the DOL reforms are at the moment. What is your latest thinking there? And then, third and finally, perhaps more of a difficult question. I wondered if you could comment on your thinking about the variable annuity policyholder behavior assumptions that you have at the moment. Clearly, MetLife has thrown this issue into the open, as an industry issue. And I just wondered, Darryl, whether you could give us some kind of thoughts going into Q3 as to whether you feel comfortable with your assumptions. Thank you.",   Hi there Thank you very much Three questions Firstly is just coming back on the mortality and long-term care losses in the US that have appeared in Q I just woned if you could give us a little bit more color on those And do you expect the rate increases you're filing to basically fix that problem?

But I truly think that the first half of 22 is when you'll see most of the, of the movement or the corrections in our assumptions and cure rates and mediation right. So I'd say we're going to start seeing some some data as early as this month internally and the number of cures and people moving out a forbearance, but I think the way it's going to flow through our numbers again given some of the uncertainties that Marc talked about I think will be first half of 22. And the reason, also, that is, has to be said and understood is that they had 18 months of forbearance, worst when you get to forbearance earlier in 2020 and some of them went into forbearance, came out of forbearance and went back in again. But they still get to get to do to benefit from 18 month worth of forbearance, that's why some of them will coming out of their 18 month in the fourth quarter. And many of them in the first and second quarter. Next, so it seems like some of them were able to get, get back current for four, five months and went back to forbearance program. That's why we have this lengthy adjustment period.",   Well let me st I'd say we may see a little in the fourth quer but that will be I don't think everything will be resolved But I truly think that the first half of  is when you'll see most of the of the movement or the corrections in our assumptions and cure rates and mediation right So I'd say we're going to st seeing some some data as early as this month internally and the number of cures and people moving out a forbearance but I think the way it's going to flow through our numbers again given some of the uncertainties that  talked about I think will be first half of  And the reason also that is has to be said and unstood is that they had  months of forbearance worst when you get to forbearance earr in  and some of them went into forbearance came out of forbearance and went back in again But they still get to get to do to benefit from  month worth of forbearance that's why some of them will coming out of their  month in the fourth quer And many of them in the first and second quer Next so it seems like some of them were able to get get back current for four five months and went back to forbearance program That's why we have this lengthy adjustment period,quer half movement correction assumption cure rate mediation datum month number cure people forbearance way number uncertainty half reason unstood month forbearance forbearance earr forbearance forbearance month worth forbearance month quer quer month forbearance program adjustment period,"['correction', 'cure', 'mediation', 'cure', 'forbearance', 'uncertainty', 'unstood', 'forbearance', 'forbearance', 'forbearance', 'forbearance', 'worth', 'forbearance', 'forbearance']",36,250,9,6.944444444444445,4.0,14,0.0039944346,0.0056510987,0.13133004,0.00711575,0.0026176956,0.0039602765,0.0059255627,0.0059698136,0.0061873146,0.008405327,0.006457624,0.007953061,0.0070899087,0.004276246,0.00864975,0.004287686,0.0058254227,0.009873721,0.0070027243,0.0031064549,0.0066258833,0.00490473,0.0007335518,0.0055442443,0.72291726,0.005743957,0.007850464,topic_25
