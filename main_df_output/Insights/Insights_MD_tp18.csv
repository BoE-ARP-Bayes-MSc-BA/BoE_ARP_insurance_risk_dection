The coronavirus is obviously on everybody's minds. Based on current available information coming from public sources and from our clients and partners about the spread of the virus and the fatality rate, we do not foresee this epidemic as having a material impact on our book. We are monitoring the situation closely and, if there are any changes to this assessment, we will update the market in subsequent disclosures. On the Life side, exposure could arise from mortality and medical expense business. There is a strong focus on containment, on clear communication and on self-protection measures by the Chinese and now also by global authorities. With the information that is known at present, we are in a situation that has nothing to do with the one in 200 year extreme stress scenario that we disclosed. China represents only a minor amount of this scenario. SGL writes about EUR9 billion of total gross written premiums per year, of which just over EUR1 billion comes from Asia. Of that EUR1 billion, around EUR400 million comes from China, where we mostly write critical illness and medical expense business with limited mortality exposure. Total death to date from COVID-19 are less than 3,000. Put this into context, our 1-in-200 extreme stress endemic scenario allows for in excess of 10 million deaths in the general population. It is also worth noting that the WHO estimates that global deaths arising from seasonal influenza epidemics are between 290,000 and 650,000 per annum, which is between 100 and 200 times more than the current COVID-19 estimated total deaths. We would also note that, impacts upon insured and general uninsured populations do differ as a result of different levels of access to medical care and other factors. On the non-life side, exposures could arise from non-proportional property contracts for commercial and industrial risks. At the moment, we do not see any impact on property contracts for commercial risks such as hotels or commercial buildings. For Industrial risks, infectious disease is usually excluded. SCOR's investment for the portfolio has limited overall equity exposure at 2% of total invested assets, mostly through convertible bonds that is subject to any broader macroeconomic effects. Further, SCOR has limited credit exposure to the retail, leisure, hotel and airlines sectors, the sectors most likely to be affected. In summary and to reiterate with the information that we have at present, the Group believes exposures are currently limited and we do not foresee this epidemic as having a material impact on our book. Let me now hand back to Mark.",   Thank you - Let's move to Slide  The coronavirus is obviously on everybody's minds Based on current available information coming from public sources and from our cnts and pners about the spread of the virus and the fatality rate we do not foresee this epidemic as having a material impact on our book We are monitoring the situation closely and if there are any changes to this assessment we will update the market in subsequent disclosures On the  side exposure could arise from mortality and medical expense  There is a strong focus on containment on clear communication and on self-protection measures by the ese and now also by global authorities h the information that is known at present we are in a situation that has nothing to do with the one in  year extreme stress scenario that we disclosed a represents only a minor amount of this scenario SGL writes about EUR billion of total gross written premiums per year of which just over EUR billion comes from  Of that EUR billion around EUR million comes from a where we mostly write critical illness and medical expense  with ed mortality exposure Total death to date from COVID- are less than  Put this into context our -in- extreme stress endemic scenario allows for in excess of  million deaths in the general population It is also worth noting that the WHO estimates that global deaths arising from seasonal influenza epidemics are between  and  per annum which is between  and  times more than the current COVID- estimated total deaths We would also note that impacts u insured and general uninsured populations do differ as a result of different levels of access to medical care and other factors On the non-life side exposures could arise from non-proportional property contracts for  and industrial s At the moment we do not see any impact on property contracts for  s such as hotels or  buildings For Industrial s infectious disease is usually excluded SCOR's  for the portfolio has ed overall equity exposure at % of total invested assets mostly through convertible bonds that is subject to any broa macroeconomic effects Further SCOR has ed credit exposure to the retail leisure hotel and airs sectors the sectors most likely to be affected In summary and to reiterate with the information that we have at present the  beves exposures are currently ed and we do not foresee this epidemic as having a material impact on our book Let me now hand back to ,coronavirus mind information source cnt spread virus fatality rate epidemic impact book situation change assessment market disclosure side exposure mortality expense focus containment communication self protection measure authority information situation year stress scenario amount scenario premium year illness expense mortality exposure death date context stress scenario excess death population death influenza epidemic time death impact u population result level access care factor side exposure property contract s moment impact property contract s hotel building disease portfolio ed equity exposure % asset bond broa effect ed credit exposure leisure hotel air sector sector summary information beve exposure ed epidemic impact book,"['coronavirus', 'mind', 'source', 'cnt', 'spread', 'virus', 'fatality', 'epidemic', 'situation', 'assessment', 'disclosure', 'exposure', 'mortality', 'containment', 'communication', 'protection', 'measure', 'authority', 'situation', 'stress', 'scenario', 'scenario', 'illness', 'mortality', 'exposure', 'death', 'context', 'stress', 'scenario', 'excess', 'death', 'population', 'death', 'influenza', 'epidemic', 'death', 'population', 'access', 'care', 'factor', 'exposure', 'contract', 'moment', 'contract', 'hotel', 'building', 'disease', 'exposure', 'bond', 'broa', 'credit', 'exposure', 'leisure', 'hotel', 'air', 'sector', 'sector', 'summary', 'beve', 'exposure', 'epidemic']",84,569,23,6.773809523809524,3.652173913043478,61,0.01756823,0.0019042655,0.0023291418,0.049028262,0.0021212415,0.0016045885,0.0006857895,0.0017302204,0.0013984904,0.0021491672,0.0015695507,0.0011229629,0.04799382,0.001957635,0.0008591774,0.00055213587,0.078938834,0.5821431,0.0011566915,0.12760994,0.0020491232,0.050045293,0.018412411,0.0005879211,0.0010606148,0.00092683564,0.0009112043,0.0015832956,topic_18
208,Astrid Frey,20171121_Swiss_Re_AG-_Guidance_Call_2017-11-21_SD000000002905253202.pdf,2017-11-21,44.0,1,0,Swiss Re,"Thanks, Kurt. Welcome everyone. So I will start with the global economic environment. And the global economic environment is quite a favorable one currently. So the cyclical upswing in the major economies continues. This positive environment is also reflected in the financial market environment. The S&P 500 in the U.S. reaches a new all-time high almost every week and volatility has dropped to the pre-crisis level. But we shouldn't be complacent about this environment, because there's a number of risks that could derail our outlook and I'll address these in turn. So while the global economic outlook is quite a favorable one, it's also not an overly exciting one at the same time. I think, you can see from this chart here with the blue bars representing the growth estimates for this year and the bars further to the right reflecting our projections for the next two years. Global economic growth is expected to remain steady and in fact in most economic regions of the world, we see either stable growth or a slight deceleration with the notable exception of Latin America, which is, however, mainly due to Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil. So key markets emerging from recession. So what does that global environment, which is quite a positive one for inflation and interest rates -- actually inflation has remained surprisingly moderate, given this continued economic expansion, economies recovering. There's a variety of reasons for that. But over the long run, or over the medium term, we'd expect then inflation to pick up. And as a consequence, we'd also expect the U.S. Fed to continue hiking interest rates. We expect 3 more rate hikes next year and another (3) in 2019. Europe is a little bit further behind. So we don't expect any rate hikes by the ECB before the end of 2019 -- sorry, we expect the ECB to hike rates at the earliest in 2019 and probably rather towards the end of the year. The Bank of England is a bit of a special case here. The interest rate outlook in the U.K. is quite uncertain. Somehow, we expect 1 rate hike each this year and next. But that's very, very much dependent on the outcome of the Brexit negotiation. So big uncertainty there. We also expect global yields to rise a bit, although from still very moderate levels. And that rise is expected to happen on a global scale. So not only in the U.S. but also and to a somewhat lesser degree in Europe. So I've already mentioned that we shouldn't get complacent by the low financial markets volatility and this positive economic environment, because there's a number of risks out there. On the more negative side, many people are worried about QE tapering. So about central banks reducing some of the stimulus. That's a risk we're not overly worried about, because central banks have been very diligent in communicating any changes. Also they have adopted very gradual approaches. Another risk that we're not overly worried about is the risk related to the euro area. But we have to recognize that not all of the issues have been solved that contributed to the global debt crisis a few years ago. Nevertheless, I think, it's fair to say that risks facing the Eurozone are currently very much lower than at the beginning of the year. And that assessment did not change by the uncertain election outcome and the failure of forming a new government in Germany. Now still remaining in Europe. But crossing the channel, I think it's also fair to say that the risk of a disorderly Brexit has probably increased over the last few months, given the lack of significant progress in the Brexit negotiations. A disorderly Brexit would likely have a negative impact from the U.K. economy. But obviously that depends very much on the assumptions of that disorderly Brexit scenario you take. It would probably also have a negative impact on the rest of the European Union. But to a much lesser degree. A risk we're much more worried about is -- comes from the U.S. administration and it's very protectionist (inaudible). If the U.S. administration becomes much more aggressive in its protectionism and in an extreme scenario that could result in a trade war, that then will be a scenario that could derail our global growth outlook, not only in the U.S.. But really across the globe. Another risk that we have been monitoring for quite a long time is a risk of a hard landing of the Chinese economy. That risk mainly relates to the fact that corporate debt burdens have increased quite dramatically since the onset of the financial crisis. Now admittedly, recently there has been some progress or success in at least containing the further buildup of corporate debt. But that risk is rather contained and by far not resolved completely. And finally and to conclude with a negative risk, I think, it's also a fair assessment to say that geopolitical risks have increased since the start of the year, although the implications for the global economy are very, very hard to quantify. Now bearing all these negative risks in mind, we shouldn't neglect the fact that there are also quite a few positive risks on the horizon, the most prominent one probably stemming from U.S. fiscal policy, with some progress recently when it comes to U.S. corporate tax reform. But there is also upside risk from Europe, for example, the cyclical upswing in Europe could turn out to be much stronger, even stronger than we currently assume. So with that fairly positive economic outlook. But also a few risks out there, I'd like to hand over to Kurt -- or hand back to Kurt and what this means for the P&C industry.",Thanks  Welcome everyone So I will st with the global economic

As John already mentioned, our Q1 results were impacted by $476 million of COVID-19 claims. Of these, $253 million were in P&C Reinsurance and $223 million in Corporate Solutions. These reflects claims notifications as well as evidence of expected claims materialized as of end of March. Close to 75% of the reinsurance loss and over 80% of the Corporate Solutions loss relates to event cancellation, with the remainder mostly coming from business interruption and smaller amounts from other lines including credit and surety. As previously communicated, our total maximum exposure to event cancellation across 2020 is a mid-to high triple digit million amount. This is due toward the first half of the year in terms of events covered, which means, you would expect to book most of the losses in the first two quarters. On credit and surety, we would expect further losses as the recession impact of the crisis becomes more visible in various economies. Economic development remains highly uncertain, depending, for example, on the effectiveness of substantial government interventions. P&C Re has a 10% market share in credit and surety, and Corporate Solutions less than 3% of the overall primary market, both with a high global diversification across the range of industries. Business interruption remains the most debated area of impact in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. We reiterate that most property policies require a physical trigger and among those that offer coverage for non-damage business interruption, not all would cover pandemic. In a number of markets, insurance had provided non-damage business interruption expansions that cover pandemic. However, which despite generally tied supplements, could add up to a material loss burden. We are monitoring the regulatory and legislative initiatives very closely. We echoed deep concerns voiced by a number of our clients, peers, and insurance regulators on the danger of potential retrospective changes to insurance contract wording. Moving onto Life & Health Re, we had so far not seen a net impact on our business from increased mortality. For instance, mortality experience in the US is in line with our expectations in the first quarter. We continue to monitor the trends here very closely, including any changes in lapse behavior and possible increases in disability claims. I would mention that a 5% mortality increase in insured mortality over a one year period would imply additional claims of approximately $400 million for Reinsurance and USD15 million for Life Capital. The current scale of the impact of COVID on our book is still far from such a scenario. A word on our 1-in-200 year pandemic stress. We previously disclosed excess mortality numbers this figure assumes in key countries, for instance, 200,000 in the US. Globally, our scenario assumes 14.5 million excess deaths. It should be noted, however, that this scenario is based on an influenza pandemic, which assumes a very different age fatality profile to COVID-19. The current virus disproportionally affects all the demographics with an average age of above 80 for fatalities, while 90% of our Life & Health Re portfolio covers individuals aged 60 or below. Overall, there are still a number of key unknowns when it comes to assessing the ultimate potential impact of COVID-19 on our underwriting portfolio in 2020, the main ones being the severity and duration of the economic downturn as well as the outcome of litigation and legislative initiatives around coverage for business interruption. However, we believe that the impact will be manageable and will represent an earnings event rather than a capital event for Swiss Re. With that, let me hand over to Guido.",   Thank you  and good morning and good afternoon from my side As  already mentioned our Q results were impacted by $ million of COVID- claims Of these $ million

So Jerome mentioned before, we have a probability of 35% for a U.S. or a global recession within the next year. And so the question is what does it mean for insurance industry? And there's a couple of transmission mechanisms how insurance industry is affected. So first, on the investment side, all insurance companies would lose from investments -- on the investment side and from lower interest rates going forward. Then there is an impact on demand, demand would be (no more) growth. Premium growth would be more moderate due to slower exposure growth, lower incomes due to weak labor markets and so on. And there are certain lines of business that are more affected like trade-credit, or marine transports types of lines that are more tied into the economy. And particularly if you have a trade war scenario that triggers this recession, then this marine-related or export-related lines of business would be affected even more. But then there are also -- for non-life insurers, there are impacts on the claims cost side. And that's quite interesting. So there is an impact on frequency. And we showed it here on the right side in the graph. Credit and surety will be affected. And for example, through more insolvency during a recession, you will have more claims on that side. And the (D&O) lines might actually also be affected through more securities fraud class actions that relates to stock market meltdowns. But the other that we showed that on the left-side chart, is a very interesting story. And that relates to the claims severity. And we see that for a lot of lines of business, particularly casualty lines, recessions will actually result in an easing of claims escalation. And so there is disinflation that follows -- or it is a result of slack in an economy during recession will actually benefit these lines of business through a lower claims severity going forward. So this is an important counter-effect benefit that will also play out through a couple of years. And this is what this chart on the left side shows, this is the combined ratio. And we see the dotted line is the beginning of a recession. And so we see these are 2 relevant U.S. recessions from the past. And we saw a run-up of claims inflation or combined ratios before the recession and then for a couple of years, a disinflationary benefit on the claims side. And how would this translate to the current picture of profitability? So last year, we did an exercise where we looked at (other) estimates. What is the profitability level of the nonlife industry worldwide if we iron out some of one-off items? And we had this -- if you look at these bars here, this is the profitability gap. We see that 6% to 9% of premium are missing just to achieve a 10% target ROE in most of these markets, largest insurance markets, North America, Europe and Japan. That's if we -- so if we take out unusual cat losses and reserve releases and so on. And so this is the -- shows the weak situation of profitability at this point. Now if we have a recession scenario. And we assume that interest rates drop further. And we assume here a 50 basis point drop across these markets, realistic at the current low interest rate environment, we will see that another 1% to 1.5% of premium profitability gap would widen -- would open up more as a result of this. Then there would be some offsetting benefit from what I mentioned in the prior slide, the story of the -- of disinflation, which is -- would be a slow-moving benefit that will play out a little bit over time. So this is additional stress from the investment side. We don't think that this would be a moderate recession, it would pressure profitability. We don't think this would be a capital event in that respect. There are benefits on the claims side. But then there's also -- and that's something we have -- there are worries or concerns about what we call social inflation and noneconomic rises of claims through the changes in the legal system. And that's something that's playing out in the U.S., particularly in the moment. And we also mentioned this separately in the sigma. And there is also a slide in the appendix to cover this. With that, let's do the wrap-up and hand back to Jerome.",   All right Thanks So  mentioned before we have a probability of % for a US or a global recession within the next year And so the question is what does it mean for  industry? And there's a couple of transmission mechanisms how  industry is affected So first on the  side all  companies would lose from s -- on the  side and from lower interest rates going forward Then there is an impact on demand demand would be no more growth ium growth would be more moate due to slower exposure growth lower incomes due to weak labor markets and so on And there are certain s of  that are more affected like trade-credit or marine transports types of s that are more tied into the economy And picularly if you have a trade war scenario that triggers this recession then this marine-related or export-related s of  would be affected even more But then there are also -- for non-life insurers there are impacts on the claims cost side And that's quite interesting So there is an impact on frequency And we showed it here on the right side in the graph Credit and surety will be affected And for example through more insolvency during a recession you will have more claims on that side And the D&O s might actually also be affected through more securities fraud class actions that relates to stock market meltdowns But the other that we showed that on the left-side ch is a very interesting story And that relates to the claims severity And we see that for a lot of s of  picularly casualty s recessions will actually result in an easing of claims escalation And so there is disinflation that follows -- or it is a result of slack in an economy during recession will actually benefit these s of  through a lower claims severity going forward So this is an important counter-effect benefit that will also play out through a couple of years And this is what this ch on the left side shows this is the combined ratio And we see the dotted  is the beginning of a recession And so we see these are  relet US recessions from the past And we saw a run-up of claims inflation or combined ratios before the recession and then for a couple of years a disinflationary benefit on the claims side And how would this translate to the current picture of profitability?

First, please let me add my thanks as well to all the first responders and essential workers. Since 1930 Markel has earned a reputation of being there for its clients, partners and communities during good times and bad. This crisis is no different. As the situation has unfolded, thousands of Markel associates have done an outstanding job providing exceptional service to our customers. Our associates continue to exhibit the Markel style of flexibility spontaneity innovation and the pursuit of excellence as we all navigate this incredibly unique situation. Now I'd like to give you an update on the current impact and potential future impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our insurance, reinsurance program services and ILS operations. Collectively, these are our insurance businesses. As long-term followers of Markel will know we adhere to a consistent reserving methodology that is laid out in our 10-K. Inherent in our reserving practices is the desire to establish loss reserves that are more likely redundant than deficient. While we are consistently implementing our process as we analyze the COVID-19 situation, we cannot be certain that our estimates will prove to be more likely redundant than deficient. There are simply too many unknowns at this time given the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the event. Having completed our initial ground-up review of each of our product lines and specific policy language, we have included management's best estimate of our ultimate direct COVID-19 insurance losses in our first quarter results. As we observe other insurance-insurers' reporting results, it is clear that a variety of approaches are being taken with some companies planning to more fully reflect their COVID-19 exposures in the second quarter. Let's kick off talking about revenues. We started the year with substantial growth in the first 2.5 months continuing the momentum we had seen for the past several quarters. That quickly changed as much of the U.S. and world economies rapidly closed. We have seen a drop off in new business submissions over the past six weeks within our insurance operation leaving our written premiums during that time roughly flat to the prior year. Over the same period of time, our renewal business is holding up very well. This is obviously a small sample size and we do not believe the full impact of the COVID-19 situation and shut down is fully reflected yet. As one would expect, our small business has been hardest hit by the shutdown. We would expect premium volume to pick up as the economy start to reopen but believe it would be overly optimistic to predict a near to medium term return to the growth rates we saw at the beginning of the year. While our program services businesses generate fee income, that fee income is calculated based on premium volume written in the insurance programs we support. We would expect to see a short to medium term dip in fee income and then recovery as the U.S. economy reopens. Regarding insurance pricing, while there is reduced demand in the short to medium term, recent events only provide more evidence that rates need to increase to align with the exposures the industry insures. We are obtaining and we'll continue to push for rate increases and believe that our peers will as well. We continue to see month-over-month increases in rates through the end of March. We don't have our April data yet. We are seeing an increase in demand for Reinsurance. Insurance capital has been reduced as a result of the fallout from the pandemic and more importantly, risk appetite has reduced. Reinsurance, of course, is a form of capital in a way that derisk the primary insurance companies. We expect increased pricing and demand for the foreseeable future in Reinsurance. Our ILS operations provide a low correlation investment class to sophisticated investors. In the short run, given market disruptions, we would not expect to obtain significant new investment subscriptions. However, over the longer term we believe current events once again validate the benefit of ILS investments. Also, as I previously discussed, we see an attractive rate environment and insurance and reinsurance, which our ILS operations can take advantage of. Switching to losses, as discussed in our 10-Q and previously on this call by Jeremy, we recorded $325 million of reserves, virtually all of it (inaudible) the for direct COVID-19 insured losses in the first quarter. These reserves relate primarily to potential U.K. business interruption claims and worldwide event cancellation exposures. On the workers' compensation front, while we have received very few claims so far, we also expect to see an increase in claims that are directly related to COVID-19. It is worth noting that all of our U.S. property policies require physical damage to occur before business interruption coverage is triggered. Almost all of those policies also include a communicable disease or virus exclusion. Here I'll stop and just say some of our policies have affirmative coverage, often sublimited that would cover the events of COVID-19 and those included -- reserve estimates for those are included in our first quarter. Therefore U.S. property policies are not expected to respond to COVID-19 related business interruption losses although we will be investigating each claim on its own merits. Our reserve were based on the ground up analysis but we're also informed by very preliminary industry estimates that suggest over time COVID-19 could produce anywhere from a $50 billion to $100 billion insurance industry loss events. We would also expect to see meaningful losses indirectly related to the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the disruption in the global economy and financial markets. These could include lines such as D&O, E&O, Workers' compensation, trade credit surety and casualty losses and the possibility of these types of losses impacting Reinsurance business that we write. Similar to the losses that emerged as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, we would expect these losses-- these indirect losses to emerge over the coming quarters. Our underwriters, actuaries and claims personnel will be working to quantify the increases to our loss ratios potentially required by these indirect losses. Finally, we are prepared for elevated litigation expenses as it relates to COVID-19, particularly as it relates to business interruption claims in both the U.S. and abroad. We are taking steps to mitigate future exposure to pandemic losses by raising prices and adding policy terms and conditions including additional exclusions. There could be insurance lines were underwriting loss trends decrease and partially offset the impact of COVID-19 direct and indirect losses. An obvious example of this is private passenger auto where our participation is small other than through our relationship with Hagerty and their classic car program. However, it is too early to speculate which lines if any other than auto could have their traditional loss ratios favorably impacted and by how much. In addition, we have already seen regulatory pressure to provide rebates in some of these areas. In summary, while it is early and there are many unknowns, we believe the impact of COVID-19 to our insurance businesses is meaningful but also manageable. We have a diverse Insurance business portfolio both by geography and product line and solid liquidity and capital position. We look forward to continuing to serve our Insurance and production partners, especially as the world's economies begin to reopen.

I'm Andrew Cox, the Chief Underwriting Officer for Beazley. So as some of you may remember this time last year, we did quite a lot of work thinking through that sorts of liability claims and exposures we could expect from COVID and the associated downstream impacts like recession and addressing those in our underwriting through risk selection, price coverage, terms and conditions, and so and so forth. And we've relaunched those new underwriting guidelines for the April 1st renewals. Our central expectation back then was COVID liability claims will begin to manifest as we emerge from the pandemic and look back and started to judge who did well and who did less well. Originally, we thought that would be the end of last year. This whole thing has taken longer than I think anyone had hoped. And so we're now expecting those claims to manifest sometime in 2021 in this year. You can see from the chart on the top right here, that although there have been some COVID and related claims, they are, as yet, quite limited. There were in fact more in the first half of the year than the second and that reflects insureds looking for first-party, particularly business interruption coverage wherever they could get it. The pink lines there show not only COVID claims, but also recession claims and racial discrimination because we're tracking all those sort of mini cats. Having said that, although there haven't been many from the research that we've been doing about what sort of claims are around and our own experience, we do have a picture emerging of what we can start to expect. And I've given three examples there. On D&O, there about a couple of dozen SCAs, securities class actions so far around and COVID alleging broadly speaking misrepresentations. If you're a vaccine company misrepresented how far advanced your research was. If you're a cruise company, you may have misrepresented how clean your ships were and so on and so forth. I may have misrepresented what you're going to do with the payment protection plan loans, if you took them from the US government, that sort of thing. On the health care side, we have seen some claims around failure to prevent or transmit the virus and from a rationing of health care and environmental around cleaning up pollution. So the good news is, I think if there is good news about the stuff that those are the sorts of claims that are -- that we had contemplated when we put together our underwriting guidelines this time last year. So we haven't had to pivot to counter anything unexpected, either by line of business or by types of allegation. As I said, we do expect this to start together pace this year as the economies reopen. And we will absolutely adjust as we learn. And again I think the good news is, is that as we speak 10/12 of our book has been written new or renewed with these revised underwriting guidelines. So in a funny sort of way a longer pandemic has helped us make the liability business more COVID resilient, remembering of course, that the vast bulk of what we do is on a claims made basis, so that gives us that ability to pivot accordingly. And with that, I'll pass over to Sally to take us through the financials.",   w good morning I'm w  the  Unwriting  for Beazley So as some of you may remember this time last year we did quite a lot of work thinking through that sorts of liability claims and exposures we could expect from COVID and the associated downstream impacts like recession and addressing those in our unwriting through  selection pe coverage terms and conditions and so and so forth And we've relaunched those new unwriting guides for the April st renewals Our central expectation back then was COVID liability claims will begin to manifest as we emerge from the pandemic and look back and sted to judge who did well and who did less well Originally we thought that would be the end of last year This whole thing has taken longer than I think anyone had hoped And so we're now expecting those claims to manifest sometime in  in this year You can see from the ch on the top right here that although there have been some COVID and related claims they are as yet quite ed There were in fact more in the first half of the year than the second and that reflects insureds looking for first-py picularly  interruption coverage wherever they could get it The pink s there show not only COVID claims but also recession claims and racial discrimination because we're tracking all those sort of mini cats Having said that although there haven't been many from the research that we've been doing about what sort of claims are around and our own experience we do have a picture emerging of what we can st to expect And I've given three examples there On D&O there about a couple of dozen SCAs securities class actions so far around and COVID alleging broadly speaking misrepresentations If you're a vaccine company

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we shared in our pre-release last week and again this morning, we reported the small net loss for the quarter due to a high level of catastrophe losses, and as we expected, the loss in our non-fixed income investment portfolio. Dan we'll have more to say about both shortly. Our underlying underwriting income of $572 million pre-tax was up $254 million over the prior year quarter, benefiting from solid net earned premium and a 3.5 point improvement in the underlying combined ratio to a strong 91.4%. The pandemic and related economic conditions had only a modest net impact on our underwriting results. As I shared in my prepared remarks last quarter, there will be COVID-19 related loss activity, but there will be some offsetting decline in losses to the people across the country sheltering in place. For us in the quarter, $114 million of direct losses and $63 million of audit premium adjustments or about offset by initial estimates of favorable loss activity, most of which is in short tail line. Given the continued uncertainty, we've taken a cautious approach to recognizing the net impact of COVID-19 related loss activity. Some industry observers have speculated about the aggregate level of insured and investment losses arising out of the pandemic. We don't doubt the losses will be significant, but they won't be borne evenly across insurers. Our manageable COVIDrelated insurance losses so far this year are a reflection of our disciplined approach to risk selection, as well as terms and conditions. And as we shared with you in some detail last quarter, we managed our investment portfolio with the similar regard for balancing risk and reward. Last quarter, I commented on the potential future impacts the pandemic might have on each of our key lines of business. I'll review that again with a quarter's worth of experience. In personal auto, we've seen a meaningful drop-off in auto frequency, although that is moderating as economic activity picks up. The same time, we've taken into consideration the potential for some offsetting impact in terms of auto severity due to factors such as collisions occurring at higher speeds and driver distraction. In workers compensation, COVID-related claims mostly relate to healthcare workers and first responders, which do not represent a significant part of our book of business. Also, the frequency of those claims stabilized during the quarter, which might be attributed to an improved supply of PPE and the healthcare community having the benefit of more experience with managing COVID patients. More broadly beyond the healthcare sector, data from some of the state workers' comp systems suggest that the COVID related claim rate is low relative to the infection rate. That's likely partly attributable to the fact that the population most seriously affected by COVID-19 skews older and it's not the workforce. Nonetheless, in developing our loss estimates, we've taken into consideration the potential for the delayed reporting of claims and additional claim activity associated with recent spike in infection rates, as well as uncertainty related to the longer-term implications of the disease. As we anticipated, some states have effectively expanded the scope of workers' comp coverage by creating presumptions of compensability. In most cases, states have taken a thoughtful approach protecting workers appropriately, but not unreasonably burdening the workers compensation system, where states have acted to extend compensability, we've adjusted our loss estimates accordingly. In terms of non-COVID workers' comp losses, we've seen the lower volume of workers comp claims as workers have stayed home. This will update as people get back to the workplace. In addition to taking that into account, we have contemplated that severity could be adversely affected by injured workers delaying treatment due to the stay-athome work environment. Having said all that, our experience is that there's a low level of workers' comp claim activity associated with economic recessions. During periods of elevated unemployment, workers tend to be more motivated to stay at their jobs and the workforce tends to be more seasoned. In management liability, as we expected, we're seeing the elevated level of claim activity typically associated with stock market volatility and workforce reductions. The underlying combined ratio of this quarter at Bond & Specialty reflects that, as well as other loss activity. And we expect that the underlying combined ratio will continue to be elevated at this level or somewhat higher over the near-term. This is not the mighty experience we had in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago. Nonetheless, we expect the return from this segment will continue to be healthy. Turning to the surety business, we've been pleased to see that work is continuing on the vast majority of construction projects. However, the depth and duration of stress in the economy continues to be risk factors of the surety business. The line will also be impacted by other factors such as the financial strength in the bonded firms. As I shared last quarter, our high-quality surety book was effectively stress-tested in the 2008 financial crisis and performed well, and our underwriting approach has remained disciplined since that time. In that regard, so far, we haven't seen anything that has caused us to change our surety loss estimates. In terms of business interruption coverages under commercial property policies, there's a fair amount of litigation challenging coverage. As a reminder, our commercial property insurance policies that include business interruption, including as a result of civil authority, require losses to be caused by direct physical damage to property from a covered cause of loss. In efficient, our standard policy forms specifically exclude loss or damage caused by or resulting from a virus. A few court decisions we've seen so far, one in New York and one in Michigan, have both upheld physical damage requirements in the context of COVID-19. On the legislative front, efforts to retroactively expand coverage for business interruptions seem to be diminishing. Finally with respect to liability coverages, as people shelter-in-place, we are seeing fewer commercial auto accidents and slip-and-fall type claims. Anecdotally, we are also seeing some movement by the plaintiffs' bar to settle claims faster, but it's too soon to know how significant that benefit might be. We're also encouraged by states that have adopted COVID-related liability protections, and similar efforts that are underway in other states and at the federal level. We shouldn't let frivolous lawsuits undermine the nation's recovery. Nonetheless, we expect the plaintiffs' bar to continue to be active. Turning to the quarter on the top-line, we're very pleased with our production results. Including the auto premium refunds we provided to our customers, net written premium grew by 2% as the impact of COVID-19 uninsured exposures was more than offset by strong annual rate change in all three segments. In Business Insurance, we achieved renewal rate change of 7.4%, the highest level since 2013 and close to the record level we achieved that year. Excluding workers' comp, renewal rate change was double-digits. Importantly, retention levels remain strong. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 3%, as our domestic management liability business achieved a record renewal rate change while maintaining strong retention. In Personal Insurance, excluding the auto premium refunds, net written premiums increased by 6%, driven by strong retention in new business in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. In our Agency Homeowners business, renewal premium change remained strong at 7.7%, and we hit a record for new business. Let me take a minute to comment on the commercial rate environment. Before the pandemic struck, there were a number of industry-wide factors putting upward pressure on prices, mainly increased volatility of weather-related losses, interest rates at historical lows, and a growing recognition of higher loss trend in the liability lines. All of those conditions persist. And now, at another quarter with a very high level of weather-related losses, interest rates that are likely to be lower for longer. And while, it hasn't been a significant factor for us for reinsurance market that is hardening. And on top of that, the pandemic and related economic fallout add a sense of incremental uncertainty making this feel like one of those times not unlike in the wake of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, when the market recalibrates risk. With that as the background, we'll continue to see great gains and manage other levels of profitability to improve the outlook for returns. I'll close by saying that I couldn't be more grateful to my Travelers colleagues for their grit and commitment to taking care of our customers, our business partners, our communities and each other. Also the work they've done in recent years to advance our innovation agenda has equipped us with state-of-the-art digital tools and other capabilities that make all the difference in this environment. We were well prepared. And from here, we're well positioned. Fee from financial and operational distractions will continue uninterrupted managing our business and investing for long-term success. In short, we're confident in our ability to continue to succeed in these uncertain times and to benefit from the strength of our franchise as the economy recovers. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.",   Thank you  Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today As we shared in our pre-release last week and again this morning we reported the

Throughout the past 50 years, since its inception, since it's the 50th anniversary of SCOR, we have built a reputation of being there for our clients, employees and all the stakeholders in the most difficult times. And throughout history, we were to face the World Trade Center, (inaudible), and tsunami and so on. The unprecedented crisis we are now facing is no different. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The event is ongoing, its duration uncertain, as are the eventual extent of the wide-ranging social, economic and financial consequences. Let's move to Slide 17. As we go through this crisis, we do everything in our power to support our business partners, again our employees and local communities throughout the world, while ensuring that our operations continue efficiently. SCOR is really doing its utmost to help stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus, starting within the company. Actively protecting the health of our employees is our top priority. This is why we adopted early very strict prevention measures before fully activating a business continuity plan and switching to working from home in all group offices, by the way, a move that came before lockdown and social distancing measures that were implemented in most countries. But we're also acting outside the company as SCOR has launched a call for action, with the spread knowledge, not the virus campaign, which explains the importance of strict containment measures to combat the pandemic and calls on everyone to contribute to the fight against the spread. The Group is also sharing knowledge on the evolution of COVID-19 with a regular publication of appropriate epidemiological data. Regarding our business, the resilience of SCOR's operational capabilities supported by high performance IT systems and applications, means that the Group can continue to serve our clients in this period of crisis and immediately without any delay respond to the reinsurance needs. Let's move to Slide 18. The coronavirus pandemic is being addressed by governments via lockdown policies and fiscal stimulus and also by central banks via monetary policies to support financial markets and liquidity concerns. The outcome of these efforts and notably the time table at which the spread of the virus subsides will become clearer over time. SCOR may see an increased level of claims in its Life and P&C businesses and an increased level of assets impairments throughout 2020. But the Group is not in a position at this stage to provide reliable and credible estimates of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, of course, due to the high level of uncertainty. Whilst we await these uncertain outcomes, let me update you on what we know today. On the Life side, the current situation remains well below the one in 200 year pandemic extreme scenario disclosed by SCOR. The key exposure relates to mortality business, primarily in the US, where SCOR has a diversified portfolio, predominantly exposed to younger age and higher socioeconomic groups. There is limited exposure to lines of business impacted by economic downturn, for example, disability in France and Australia. There are some potential positive offsetting impacts over time from a longevity portfolio, but also from a long-term care portfolio in France. On the P&C side, SCOR is continuously monitoring its exposures to the COVID-19 outbreak in light of the rapidly changing environment. Many lines of business are simply not loss impacted, with minimal loss exposures even if they may be affected in terms of volume due to the nature of the coverage. Importantly, the Group has an incidental and immaterial exposure to event cancellation and contingency business. The business interruption development is very closely monitored in all relevant jurisdictions. Where the Group may see an increased level of claims is from within the Trade Credit & Surety and Political Risk portfolio, representing around 7% of the SCOR global P&C premium base. On the investment side, SCOR pursues a prudent asset management strategy and entered the COVID-19 crisis with a resilient and highly defensive investment portfolio. Furthermore, since we voluntarily de-risked the investment portfolio across 2019, the material reduction of the credit exposure and a stronger liquidity profile. SCOR's investment portfolio has a very limited exposure to listed equities at just 0.6% of invested assets. The fixed income portfolio is of very high quality with an average rating of A plus and highly liquid, with limited exposure to the most heavily affected economic sectors. Mark has already described in his presentation the very strong liquidity of the Group. Just on the asset side, we expect in excess of EUR8 billion of financial cash flows over the next 24 months. Let's move to Slide 19. The Group is today fully mobilized to anticipate, to measure and to manage the impacts of this major shock, just as it has done for the disasters in the past. As we have seen, the prudence that characterizes both underwriting and our investment policy should help us through a deeply troubled economic and financial environment. But whilst we fight today's war against the virus, we at SCOR are also thinking of tomorrow. One day, the pandemic will be over, but it may have a structural impact on modern societies. This incredible historic shock will remain a dark page in our world history because of its violence, its power and its resonance because, of course, of its universal nature. For us, it is clear that the direct and indirect economic cost of this crisis will be extensive. In addition, the contraction in economic activity, combined with massive central bank intervention and also further bloating of public deficits could foster resurgency of inflationary pressures. This is generally the consequence of injecting helicopter money into the economy. Other post-war periods are always characterized by rising inflation. Second and more fundamentally, we see changes in the behavior of all economic players. We see effects on both the demand and supply sides of the equation. The reason for this is that the current crisis is most likely going to increase people's aversion to risk to a twofold effect. First, a recognition effect, the ramp in progression of COVID-19 has made pandemic risk tangible for a very large number of people and companies who were previously either totally unaware of it, or at best underestimated this risk. Billions of individuals -- not millions, but billions of individuals are now keenly aware of this major risk. In fact, we will have an impact on every aspect in terms of behavior. The second effect is a displacement effect. As is always the case of major trauma or shock, aversion to risk and particularly to the risk in question, increases. All else being equal, the demand for security to a broader sense rises sharply and additional demands for protection appear. This provides fertile ground for multiple initiatives purporting to reduce probability of set ph risk occurring and to minimize its consequences. As individuals and consumers, all of us will change attitudes towards (inaudible) risk. In all likelihood, we'll protect ourselves more, consume differently, travel less and so on. For business and industry, meanwhile this pandemic shock will unquestionably lead to a reorganization of production chains and consequently of the international division of labor. Any companies, particularly manufacturing companies, will reevaluate the structure, organization and geographic distribution of their supply chains. They will look in a different way at the production lines, the distribution networks and the inventories. It is also likely, very likely, that teleworking will become more common. The sum total of all these impacts, behavioral changes on the part of governments, individuals and companies, could result in changes to the global economic and financial equilibrium. Finally, the political impact of the extreme shock is likely to be considerable. This health crisis, this sanitary crisis is giving rise to many serious questions about intimacy ph and freedom, a question of tracking, for instance, arising almost everywhere in each democracy. And nationally, protectionism could reemerge. Yes, for all these reasons, this major shock could change the course of history. But it is certainly too early to say how much. The good news is the current crisis does not question the relevance of the reinsurance industry or its business model. Quite the contrary, by the way, more than ever it demonstrates the essential role of the reinsurance industry, which with its fundamental function of risk pooling and its ability to absorb sudden new shocks makes it possible to ensure resilience and consequently to support the development and maintenance of societies and economies. So as a Tier 1 reinsurer, I strongly believe that SCOR is well placed to address and respond to society's ever-evolving protection needs. Let's turn now to the Q&A session. And maybe before, Ian, you could give us the agenda for the next events.",   Thank you  and welcome everybody Throughout the past  years since its inception since it's the th anniversary of SCOR we have built a reputation of being there for our cnts employees and all the stakehols in the most difficult times And throughout history we were to face the World Trade Center inaudible and tsunami and so on The unpreceted crisis we are now facing is no different On h   the World  Organization declared the COVID- outbreak a global pandemic The event is ongoing its duration uncertain as are the eventual extent of the wide-ranging social economic and financial consequences Let's move to Slide  As we go through this crisis we do everything in our power to support our  pners again our employees and local commies throughout the world while ensuring that our operations continue efficiently SCOR is really doing its utmost to help stop the spread of the COVID- virus sting within the company Actively protecting the health of our employees is our top priority This is why we adopted early very stt prevention measures before fully activating a  continuity plan and switching to working from home in all  offices by the way a move that came before lockdown and social distancing measures that were implemented in most countries But we're also acting outside the company as SCOR has launched a call for action with the spread knowledge not the virus campaign which explains the importance of stt containment measures to combat the pandemic and calls on everyone to contribute to the fight against the spread The  is also sharing knowledge on the evolution of COVID- with a regular publication of appropriate epidemiological data Regarding our  the resince of SCOR's operational capabilities supported by high performance IT systems and applications means that the  can continue to serve our cnts in this period of crisis and immediately without any ay resd to the re needs Let's move to Slide  The coronavirus pandemic is being addressed by governments via lockdown policies and fiscal stimulus and also by central banks via monetary policies to support financial markets and liquidity concerns The outcome of these efforts and notably the time table at which the spread of the virus subsides will become clearer over time SCOR may see an increased level of claims in its  and P&C es and an increased level of assets impairments throughout  But the  is not in a position at this stage to provide reliable and credible estimates of the impact of the COVID- crisis of course due to the high level of uncertainty Whilst we await these uncertain outcomes let me update you on what we know today On the  side the current situation remains well below the one in  year pandemic

So we thought use this morning a bit of an opportunity to kind of describe how we went about pricing during 2020 with respect to COVID-19. So this is COVID-19 specific as opposed to the underlying kind of claims inflation. But I guess it's important to reiterate what Adam said which was that we kind of -- we stuck to our knitting in terms of our pricing discipline. And when the lockdown struck in March 2020, what we've got here is a chart which shows our volumes, premium volume, the yellow bars. And then we've taken the government traffic volumes as a starting point. And if I can have the next slide, we were looking to predict what would happen based on what we could see so far. So, I think it's fair to say, the lockdown started and we entered the first couple of -- the first week in April, the first thing we didn't do was have a knee-jerk reaction. We stayed firm, collected some data from both models to take a view based on the information that was out there, as to how we think we're going to price going forward. Because clearly, we were pricing a policy at this point for the next 12 months and with quite a lot of uncertainty around what was going to happen and what we could see was the traffic volume is down. So I guess this first yellow, the first yellow line shows what we thought would happen to relative traffic and that was one of the inputs we use to get into our premium calculation appreciating again as the guys said that you've got things like fraud, you got things like theft not reducing during lockdowns, and then you've got this kind of knock-on effect on claim severity, increased severity costs potentially owing to COVID. So this was really just a starting point as to how we were thinking about how frequency might turn out, as of April 20. We can have the next slide, please. So you can see this is the government data and how things started to evolve. So actually we didn't get it too bad actually. I mean we undercooked a little and you can see the volumes really came up, but on average over the period we were kind of in the right ballpark. And then I think as more information -- we unlocked over the summer -- more information became available and at that point, I mean things were kind of going back to normal. I think if we go on another slide. Thank you. We then kind of saw schools went back, traffic was as nearest to normal as it had previously been. But then obviously we had the announcement that would be going into a lockdown during November and December -- halfway through November to December and we could see, we took an estimate at that point as to what would happen and you can see our estimate wasn't too in line with the government, actually what happened with hindsight. So you've kind of got November and December kind of up and down, with December up because you've got a Christmas effect wherever we knew everyone was going to be allowed out for Christmas so to speak, so we thought the time turns out, they went out and -- as long. And we took of view at that point that as that December that we -- which is the view that we didn't know we were going to go into a full lockdown from first part of 2021. But we had a feeling that we weren't going to certainly return to normal. So we took a view on where the traffic was going to be and where that would impact claims numbers and therefore, reflected that in the premiums. So if we got the next slide, please. Actually, what happened was then as we got the new information that we would be in a lockdown we redid the pricing. So each of these kind of iterations is a summary point of different iterations of pricing and as soon as we found out we were going back into a full lockdown from the beginning of January effectively we changed our assumptions around the pricing. And I guess this really reflects one of our of our most recent assumptions around pricing, which is we think we'll be back towards what I would call normal, whatever normal looks like around the June, July mark this year. But -- and so far I guess it's showing with our modeling hasn't been a million miles out in terms of the shape with respect to the actual observed traffic volumes. I think what we're kind of assuming is the unwinding of lockdown measures we saw over last summer is going to be very similar in terms of behavior, in terms of traffic volumes. But like I say, we -- our expectation based on the information we have from the government and (inaudible) is that we'll be back to normal by -around about July. And so in terms of traffic anyway, sorry.",   Sure Morning everybody Okay So we thought use this morning a bit of an opporty to kind of describe how we went about ping during  with respect to COVID- So this is COVID- specific as opposed to the unlying kind of claims inflation But I guess it's important to reiterate what  said which was that we kind of -- we stuck to our knitting in terms of our ping discip And when the lockdown struck in h  what we've got here is a ch which shows our volumes premium volume the yellow bars And then we've taken the government traffic volumes as a sting point And if I can have the next slide we were looking to predict what would happen based on what we could see so far So I think it's fair to say the lockdown sted and we entered the first couple of -- the
