NN Group has delivered another solid set of results for the third quarter of 2018, posting (001312) an increase of 7% on the same quarter last year with Netherlands Life and Netherlands Non-life reporting higher operating results. The integration of Delta Lloyd continues to progress well. Total expense reductions to date amount to €269 million as we continue to extract the synergies of the integration and drive eﬃciency throughout the organization. Our balance sheet remains strong with a cash capital position of €1.9 billion and a Solvency II ratio of 239% at the end of the third quarter. We are on track to have the expanded partial internal model approved by the end of this year and to complete the legal merges of Dutch life and non-life (001351) entities in 2019 as planned. This quarter's performance conﬁrms that we are progressing well in executing our strategy which focuses on successfully integrating Delta Lloyd, further improving the operating performance of all of our segments, accelerating the transformation of the business model and continuing to allocate capital rationally. Now before we go into Q&A, let me just mention the second press release that we issued this morning in which we announced the termination of the warrant agreement with ING for a consideration of €76 million. As you are aware, NN and ING entered into this warrant Company Name NN Group NV agreement at the time of the IPO in 2014.

And in the past year as everybody knows, we have executed a share buyback of EUR75 million per annum. The commitment was for three years and the final leg is due next Feb when we publish the full-year results. Of course, if the conditions we have said are met. We believe the share buyback program has worked well. It allows us allows us to offer additional capital returns, especially on the back of a very strong capital generation. We've decided to continue to share buyback program, and to raise the share buyback with EUR25 million to at least EUR100 million per annum. This is again a commitment for three years and contingent on our Solvency II ratio still based on the standard formula, to be above 175%. So we also lowered the threshold coming from 180%. But of course, our preference remains to grow the company profitable, so value enhancing M&A opportunities will be favored. And thus, we will hold the share buyback program in case of an interesting substantial acquisition.

So, to sum up, we're very -- and this is slide number 23. We're very pleased to be able to report a solid set of results for the second quarter of 2014, our first as a stand-alone company. While the operating profit of the ongoing business was down 6% compared with the same quarter last year, on a year-to-date basis, the operating profit went up 22%. And the net profit increased significantly this quarter to EUR252 million. We showed a solid commercial performance with higher new sales in the current quarter. Total administrative expenses were down and we have made a good start on achieving our target expense reduction. In addition, we have been successful in further strengthening our robust capital position. And our funding position is stronger and less dependent on ING Group, following the two hybrid debt issues. Excluding non-recurring items, we generated around EUR500 million of capital in the first half of the year. We're, obviously, pleased with this. But as I said earlier, please bear in mind that capital generation can be volatile. Finally, the execution of our strategy is on track and we are making encouraging progress towards delivering upon our targets. So, with that, I would like now to open the floor for your questions that Delfin; Doug Caldwell, our CRO; and myself will be ready to answer for you.

I will start today's presentation by talking about the highlights of the ﬁrst quarter results, as well as our progress on the integration in the past quarter. Delﬁn Rueda, our Chief Financial Oﬃcer will then take you through the details of the ﬁnancial results and talk about the capital position and free cash ﬂow. I will conclude the presentation with a wrap-up, after which, we will open the call for Q&A. Jan-Hendrik Erasmus, our Chief Risk Oﬃcer is also with us today to answer your questions. So let's move to slide number three. NN Group's operating result of the ongoing business for the ﬁrst quarter was EUR313 million. As you know, a severe storm hit the Netherlands in January and this quarter's operating result reﬂects the related total impact of EUR89 million in our non-life and reinsurance businesses. This is more or less in line with our market share. The ﬁrst quarter operating result also includes the contribution of Delta Lloyd, while the operating result a year ago beneﬁted from 41 million of private equity dividends. The integration is progressing well and we continue to drive the improvements in eﬃciency. Further cost savings of EUR42 million were achieved this quarter in the business units in the scope of the integration, bringing total cost reductions to 175 million compared with a full year 2016 expense base. This represents half of our targeted cost reduction of 350 million by 2020, so well ahead of the earlier envisaged schedule and I will talk more about this on a later slide. Our balance sheet and capital position remained strong. NN Group's solvency position at the end of the ﬁrst quarter was 213%, up from 199% at the end of 2017, driven by a combination of positive market impacts and operating capital generation. Free cash ﬂow to the holding company was EUR198 million, bringing the cash capital at the holding company to EUR1.6 billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter. New sales were down by just under 8% at constant currencies. At Netherlands Life, there was a lower volume of existing group pension contracts, which came up for renewal this quarter. New sales at Insurance Europe increased, driven by the contribution of Delta Lloyd Belgium, while new sales in Japan remained broadly stable, despite increased local competition. Let's move to slide four. We have already achieved a number of milestones to integrate Delta Lloyd into NN Group. For example, Delta Lloyd Bank, Delta Lloyd Asset Management and Delta Lloyd Life in Belgium have been legally merged into the respective NN businesses and are now operating as combined entities. We are rebranding the Delta Lloyd products and services and re-branding has already been completed in Belgium and we expect this to be largely ﬁnalized at the other units by the Company Name NN Group NV end of the year. We are also in the process of relocating Delta Lloyd employees to NN locations. In terms of IT, the Delta Lloyd Asset Management portfolios have been transferred and are now running on NNIP's systems. We have started decommissioning some head oﬃce systems, while other systems at the business units can only be decommissioned, once policies have been migrated. We are currently working on expanding our internal model to include the Delta Lloyd Life and non-life entities and we aim to complete the mergers of the life and non-life companies in 2019. We are well on-track, but obviously still have a lot of work to do and some of the more complex integration projects are ahead of us. Throughout the integration process, we make sure that we never lose sight of our customers. This process ph was particularly evident following the January storm. We were there for our customers in their time of need and were able to settle most of the thousands of storm claims within one month. Our focus is also on maintaining our commercial momentum by oﬀering our customers innovative solutions and value-added products, while at the same time, writing proﬁtable new business by focusing on value, rather than volume. We continue to launch new protection products in Europe and we have opened a new innovation Sparklab in Spain to develop creative solutions and drive innovation in that country. So, let's turn now to slide number ﬁve. At our Capital Markets Day last year, we announced our target to reduce the administrative expense base for all the business units in the scope of integration by around 350 million by the end of 2020, of which 50% by the end of 2018. As I mentioned earlier, the integration is progressing well and we have already realized a total cost reduction of EUR175 million at the end of the ﬁrst quarter. This means that we are well ahead of schedule. Now given the strong process so far and progress so far, we have announced today that we are raising the cost reduction guidance to EUR400 million by the end of 2020 and expect to achieve at least half of these savings by the end of this year. The split of the total cost reductions by segments can be seen in the right-hand graph on slide number ﬁve. We are conﬁdent that we can continue our track record of cost discipline and achieve the targeted cost reductions. And with that, I would like to hand you over to our CFO, Delﬁn Rueda.",   Yes good morning everyone and welcome to our conference call to discuss NN 's results for the ﬁrst quer of  I will st today's presentation by talking about the highlights of the ﬁrst quer results as well as our progress on the integration in the past quer   our    will then take you through the details of the ﬁnancial results and talk about the capital position and free cash ﬂow I will conclude the presentation with a wrap-up after which we will open the call for Q&A -

And as you can see on slide 11, Alka have had a long track record of very good combined ratios, and they are here compared to Tryg's private business. So, very much in line with how Tryg's private business has been performing. There has been a period of elevated run-oﬀ in Alka, and during our due diligence, we actually found that we were dealing here with a company that was even more conservative in their reserving practice than Tryg has been. So, a very strong due diligence and very strong balance sheet when looking at the reserves of Alka. The 2016 numbers that kind of peaks up a little bit is, however, some work that was done on the reserving models, giving a peak to the results, but in 2017 we see the results coming back down to historical levels – or the combined ratio coming back down. On page 12, which is basically our DKK 300 million beneﬁt, merger beneﬁt, and I think it's important here that we're calling it merger beneﬁt. From our point of view, we can see a lot of things that we can learn from Alka and that Alka can learn from us. Morten has already mentioned on the claims side and we see here about 45% of the DKK 300 million is coming from claims. When we, at the Capital Market Day, showed that we are detecting 1.5% of fraudulent claims, Alka is excess 4% of detection. That's 3 percentage points more detection than Tryg is doing. Basically, this is where a lot of the value is going to be driven and where are going to learn a lot from Alka, taking their models and their data analytical models to improve our business in Tryg's name (1417). On the procurement side, this is an area that Alka has not been working on for the past, as much as Tryg has, and for example, looking at – when we showed on the Capital Market Day that we have a 6.6% average better procurement on auto, Alka does not have this, Company Name Tryg A/S but when we merge together, Alka will beneﬁt from this procurement agreement that we have and thereby giving us better performance in Alka. On the cost optimization, we basically are talking about double functions and a lot of these double functions will be reduced by natural churn. The other 25% of revenue optimization and commercial best practice, Morten has already mentioned their presence online; with 36% online sales, they have been working with cost of sales over the past many years, where Tryg is just getting started and we have much to learn from Alka here. Generally, the use of data and analytics is an area that we will beneﬁt and reap a lot of beneﬁts from over the next coming years. However, on the product and services side, we can see that our product oﬀering is much larger than what Tryg is and there we can sell more products to the Alka members or the Alka customers. And lastly on component then (1539) you wouldn't ﬁnd in the normal cost ratio, but is a synergy for us; it's about 5% of reinsuring and investment synergies where combining the two entities are going to give us this beneﬁt. Bear in mind that there is a DKK 250 million transition cost that will aﬀect our 2018 numbers. Turning to the next page, which is the funding page, as Morten has already mentioned, the DKK 8.2 billion consists of DKK 2.5 billion excess capital in Alka that would be released upon closing. The price paid is then DKK 5.7 billion and of that, we are raising DKK 4 billion of equity, which has been fully underwritten by TryghedsGruppen at a minimum price of DKK 146 guaranteed. Furthermore, to ﬁnance this transaction, we have our Tier 1 capital issue that will be done during Q1 2018, and we have DKK 1.2 billion of Tryg capital used for this transaction. Trying to put – on the next page which is our solvency ratio and pro forma, again, trying to give these moving parts a little bit of content, we have put a solvency ratio pro forma based on Q3, 2017. How would our solvency ratio look if we apply all these numbers, and it ends up at 170%. Now, bear in mind, once upon closure, these numbers will diﬀer to the extent that time has passed and we will kind of get the ﬁnal numbers on all these components. I think that was on the ﬁnancial side. Morten, back to you to summarize.",   Thank you  And as you can see on slide  Alka have had a long track record of very good combined ratios and they are here compared to 's private  So very much in  with how 's private  has been performing There has been a period of elevated run-oﬀ in Alka and during our due diligence we actually found that we were dealing here with a company that was even more conservative in their reserving practice than  has been So a very strong due diligence and very strong balance sheet when looking at the reserves of Alka The  numbers that kind of peaks up a little bit is however some work that was done on the reserving mos giving a peak to the results but in  we see the results coming back down to histoal levels – or the combined ratio coming back down On page  which is basically our DKK  million beneﬁt merger beneﬁt and I think it's important here that we're calling it merger beneﬁt From our point of view we can see a lot of things that we can learn from Alka and that Alka can learn from us  has already mentioned on the claims side and we see here about % of the DKK  million is coming from claims When we at the Capital et  showed that we are detecting % of fraudulent claims Alka is excess % of detection That's  percentage points more detection than  is doing Basically this is where a lot of the value is going to be driven and where are going to learn a lot from Alka taking their mos and their data analytical mos to improve our  in 's name  On the procurement side this is an area that Alka has not been working on for the past as much as  has and for example looking at – when we showed on the Capital et  that we have a % average better procurement on auto Alka does not have this  Name  A/S but when we merge together Alka will beneﬁt from this procurement agreement that we have and thereby giving us better performance in Alka On the cost optimization we basically are talking about double functions and a lot of these double functions will be reduced by natural churn The other % of revenue optimization and  best practice  has already mentioned their presence on;

I would like to -- you to take away from today's presentation that we have made early progress on our plans to transform Aegon. We have increased our operating result by 20% to EUR431 million. We are executing on our operational improvement plan and are intensifying the organizational rhythm. We are on track to deliver on our expense savings target. We have significantly reduced our interest rate risk and we'll take more steps later this year. We have made steady progress on optimizing our financial assets, including achieving rate increases in long-term care. We continue to invest in new products, product distribution and customer service in our Strategic Assets, and we have further increased our strategic focus through the divestment of non-core businesses. Lastly, we are working together with the Vienna Insurance Group to close the divestment of our businesses in Central and Eastern Europe. In summary, I'm pleased with the results we announced today and how well we are progressing on our strategic commitments and financial targets. But the journey has only just begun. We will continue to drive our transformation and increase our speed of execution, and we will do that in a rational and disciplined way. Looking to the future, I'm confident in the strength of our business, our strategy and the unwavering commitment of our employees to continue delivering on our plans.

1179,Jos Baeten,20200219_ASR_Nederland_NV-_Earnings_Call_2020-2-19_DN000000002794002561.pdf,2020-02-19,280.0,1,0,ASR Nederland," 2036695  Thanks, Annemiek. Well done. And let's move quickly to slide 17, so we're not making Michel more nervous than necessary for the Q&A. Two graphs on this slide, the first one to highlights our steady multi-year increase in our operating results. And as you can see, our non-life business and capitallight free income-generating business in asset management and distribution represent a greater part of the total company and the new business we are writing in those businesses will push this further going forward. Secondary market -- those results will fuel our capacity to pay attractive dividends to our shareholders. And, as you know, it's our ambition to offer shareholders a progressive dividend per share in the long-term asset. Full-year dividend will grow towards EUR1.90 per share, an increase of 9.2%. And on top of that, we aim to provide additional capital distribution as we announced this morning with the share buyback program of EUR75 million for this year. So, all in all, since our IPO in 2016, we've returned well over EUR1 billion to our shareholders in dividends and share buybacks. If we would be able to execute on our intention as we just discussed, then we would again return another EUR1 billion in the current plan period. So concluding on slide 18 and guiding you a little bit towards the outlook for 2020, again a very strong set of numbers, so a very solid performance again from ASR. As is evidence from all the key metrics that we discussed, our business is running very, very well, and we're happy that everything we can influence has done according to targets or better than targets. Looking ahead, we are positive about the commercial and operational outlook for ASR. However, we are keeping a close eye on developments in the financial markets and in particular the impact of the exceptionally low interest rates. And while there are no new facts on the EIOPA review, we will of course monitor any regulatory change that may have an impact. At the same time, we remain interested in growth through small and medium-sized acquisitions. We still see opportunities there. Our strong capital position provides sufficient scope for this. So, looking forward, acknowledging that our performance in 2019 was very strong and significantly increased compared to the prior year, we would be very happy if and when we could deliver those results again in 2020. So, with that, I hand over to the operator to go into all the questions you probably will have.

I welcome all the people gathered here in this room in Zurich, as well as all those joining us on the phone. I'm very pleased to present to you our 2016 full-year results. We are looking back on an intense and successful year 2016, which resulted in a solid business development. During this presentation, I would like to give you detailed information on the key aspects of our 2016 financial statements. So, let us turn to slide number 3. Following my introduction, our CFO, Paul Norton, will explain the key financial figures to you, report briefly on the highlights of our business performance in our Swiss home market, and then present our investments result. I will then provide you with an update of the implementation of the helvetia 20.20 strategy. Following the presentation, Paul Norton and I, as well as our Chief Investment Officer, Ralph Honegger, will be pleased to answer your questions as always. I will start with slide number 4. First of all, I would like to share with you a brief overview of the main performance indicators. Paul will give you detailed information on the developments of these figures later on. Let us begin with the underlying earnings, which achieved a pleasing increase of 12% to CHF 492 million in 2016. The improvement was driven by the non-life business and the other activities, while the life business was more or less stable despite the ongoing challenging environment. In the non-life business, the good technical development underpins the earnings performance. The business area, other activities, also benefited from a better technical result from Group Reinsurance. The solid technical performance in the non-life business is also reflected in the net combined ratio that improved by 0.5 percentage points to 91.6%. Thanks to the very good progress of the integration of Nationale Suisse and Basler Austria, underlying earnings already included synergies of more than CHF 118 million pre-tax on a yearly cost basis. Back in 2015, CHF 45 million synergies pre-tax were included in underlying earnings. The integration of Nationale Suisse is almost completed. The merger of the operating Italian entities is still outstanding, but will be realized in the course of this year according to our plan. Business volume increased by 2.6% in original currency to more than CHF 8.5 billion. Life business volume grew by 3.4% in original currency. Let me highlight that the modern capital-efficient life products showed very satisfactory growth, resulting in an increase of over 18% in original currency compared to last year. The non-life business volume was impacted by portfolio optimization measures, which have been initiated following the acquisition of Nationale Suisse, as already communicated at the full-year results presentation one year ago. These measures had a negative impact on volume growth, which was therefore only 1.5%. The portfolio optimizations are almost completed by now and should therefore affect volumes in 2017 to a lesser extent. I also want to highlight that the new business margin in the life business rose from 0.9% in the previous year to 1.3% in the current year. This improvement shows that we have successfully turned our new business towards modern capital-efficient products. Ladies and gentlemen, when acquiring Nationale Suisse, we promised our shareholders a step-up (831) in dividends as soon as synergies are realized. Now that we are ahead of our original timetable with the synergy realization, we want our shareholders to benefit from this by speeding up part of the dividend increase as well. So, I am very happy to announce that the Board of Directors will propose to the Shareholders' Meeting to increase the dividend to CHF 21 per share. Please understand, however, this does not mean that we increase our dividend every year by CHF 2 per share. The timing and the amount of the increases in the future will, of course, depend on both further realization of synergies, and following the completion of the synergy program, the usual considerations around profits and capital adequacy. I will now continue with the details on the achieved synergies on slide number 5. As of end 2016, Helvetia had 585 full-time employee equivalents fewer than it did as of June 30, 2014 when we started synergy tracking. Of these employees, 446 left the company due to the two acquisitions and can therefore be counted as net staff synergies. As of January 1, 2017, an additional 30 employees left the company, but they have not yet been included in the reductions mentioned above. At the same time, however, we have a slight counter effect with the business investments that were made to support our strategy, in particular in IT and to expand functions that Nationale Suisse had outsourced. The staff reduction corresponds to around CHF 82.8 million in personnel cost savings on a yearly cost basis. We also generated non-personnel cost savings of CHF 35.5 million in 2016. In particular, synergies were achieved here through a reduction in redundancies in the areas of IT, logistics, marketing and corporate. Overall, we realized synergies of CHF 118.3 million, and I am happy to confirm once again that we make great progress in achieving our target. Originally, we were setting forth a range of between CHF 105 million to CHF 130 million. In the meantime, we are confident to end up at the higher end of this range. With that, I would like to turn over the presentation to our CFO, Paul Norton, who will now provide you with the most important information about the key financial figures.",Ladies and gentlemen I
