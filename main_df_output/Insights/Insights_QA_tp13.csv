Well, first of all turning to Slide 20, which is up on the screen here, you will see the new business strain on the slide, which is a negative GBP0.2 billion. So, just a reminder, what we said that comprises a GBP101 million from the BPA business that we wrote during the year, which includes the capital management policy amounts related to that business. A roughly GBP60 billion relating to vesting annuity businesses and GBP40 million balance relates to the Standard Life business, which we've described previously as capital-light. I think in the Capital Markets Day, we had said, we believe that strain to be slightly positive, but once we've run the year-end numbers, it turned out to be marginally negative, but fundamentally is capital-light business. In terms of thinking forward, in terms of our use of capital, you will have seen from one of the other slides, that our cash builds up over the five-year period from GBP0.3 billion to GBP1.3 billion. So, we will be accumulating additional amounts of surplus through, which we will continue to invest that in BPA business and in the Standard Life business and in supporting future M&A. Now the key thing about -- thinking about the bulk annuities business, is we have used the phrase in the past that we will enter that market on a selective and proportionate basis and that remains the position. We are always going to fund this BPA business from our own resources. And we have given guidance that we will expect between GBP500 million and GBP1 billion of liabilities over the course of the year. So, the strain from that BPA business will be around GBP100 million mark on avergae. And we continue to see the -obviously the Standard Life business will have a very minimal capital strain. So, we're very comfortable with that those new business opportunities that the capital costs are well manageable within the ongoing business, as we go forward. Your second question was around longevity risk and our risk appetite. So, roughly about 55% of longevity risk is reinsured as of the present time. While we are thinking about BPA deals, we are reinsuring a larger proportion of that business, so up to 90% or so on average for the new business to do with BPAs. And we continue to keep the overall longevity risk appetite under review, and if it was necessary, we would take action to keep it well within our risk appetite. We don't have any particular issues with our risk appetite at present and are very comfortable with the overall position.",   Okay I think they're both for me Well first of all turning to Slide  which is up on the screen here you will see the new  strain on the slide which is a negative GBP billion So just a remin what we said that comprises a GBP million from the BPA  that we wrote during the year which includes the capital  policy amounts related to that  A roughly GBP billion relating to vesting annuity es and GBP million balance relates to the Standard   which we've described previously as capital-light I think in the Capital ets  we had said we beve that strain to be slightly positive but once we've run the year-end numbers it turned out to be marginally negative but fundamentally is capital-light  In terms of thinking forward in terms of our use of capital you will have seen from one of the other slides that our cash builds up over the five-year period from GBP billion to GBP billion So we will be accumulating additional amounts of surplus through which we will continue to invest that in BPA  and in the Standard   and in supporting future M&A Now the key thing about -- thinking about the bulk annuities  is we have used the phrase in the past that we will enter that market on a selective and proportionate basis and that remains the position We are always going to fund this BPA  from our own resources And we have given guidance that we will expect between GBP million and GBP billion of liabilities over the course of the year So the strain from that BPA  will be around GBP million mark on avergae And we continue to see the -obviously the Standard   will have a very minimal capital strain So we're very comfortable with that those new  opporties that the capital costs are well able within the ongoing  as we go forward Your second question was around longevity  and our  appetite So roughly about % of longevity  is reinsured as of the present time While we are thinking about BPA deals we are reinsuring a larger proportion of that  so up to % or so on average for the new  to do with BPAs And we continue to keep the overall longevity  appetite un review and if it was necessary we would take action to keep it well within our  appetite We don't have any picular issues with our  appetite at present and are very comfortable with the overall position,slide screen strain slide remin bpa year capital policy amount annuity balance capital light et year end number capital light term term use capital slide cash year period amount surplus bpa future thing annuity phrase past market basis position bpa resource guidance liability course year strain bpa mark capital strain opportie capital cost question longevity appetite % longevity time bpa deal proportion % longevity appetite action appetite issue appetite present position,"['screen', 'strain', 'remin', 'bpa', 'light', 'light', 'surplus', 'bpa', 'phrase', 'bpa', 'resource', 'strain', 'bpa', 'mark', 'strain', 'longevity', 'appetite', 'longevity', 'bpa', 'proportion', 'longevity', 'appetite', 'appetite', 'appetite']",61,366,23,6.0,2.652173913043478,24,0.03994589,0.003534917,0.0072560185,0.004451097,0.0016374404,0.0024772617,0.003706602,0.003734282,0.003870335,0.0052577625,0.0040394207,0.11731663,0.71593285,0.002674909,0.042857915,0.0026820651,0.0036439616,0.006176283,0.004380396,0.0019431727,0.0041446714,0.003068043,0.00045885675,0.0034680767,0.0028374197,0.0035930027,0.0049106805,topic_13
