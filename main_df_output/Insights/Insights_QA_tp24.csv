Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly explain the remuneration of the members of the Executive Board. But before I do so I would first like to make some general remarks on the company's remuneration policy, which is clear, transparent and applicable to all NN employees. Our remuneration policy with which we, at NN, are able to attract and retain qualified employees were quite aware as members of the Supervisory Board that the remuneration's topic is quite sensitive and is getting a lot of public attention. In the drafting and the implementation of the remuneration policy as a Supervisory Board, we also keep in mind the interest of the different stakeholders of NN Group. So that would be our clients, first and foremost, shareholders, employees and also the society in which NN operates, which is both in the Netherlands and in other countries. An issue here is to find a good balance in which we consider the international nature of the company as well. We make sure that the remuneration policy as the NN Group supports the long-term goals of the company, which is focusing on clients' interest, solid operation and risk control. And in order to achieve these goals, it's absolutely necessary to attract and retain qualified employees. NN, as an international company. And our standards in terms of quality are very high. And so therefore, we're also looking at the international labor market in order to be able to attract the right employees. Now these are my general remarks in terms of remuneration policy. And now I'd like to zoom in on the Executive product -- Board. The remuneration policy for the Executive Board has been established by the General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2015 and has been applicable since the 1st of January, 2015. This remuneration policy is in line, as you know, with the law on remuneration policy for financial companies, the WBFO ph, which means variable remuneration of a maximum of 20%. The fixed remuneration will consist of 80% of an amount of money and 20% will consist of an amount in shares in the NN Group. And the members of the Executive Board must retain the shares that they receive for a period of five years. And furthermore, they also can claim further conditions, perks and for the pension system, the Executive Board has the same pension system as all other employees of NN. Ladies and gentlemen, variable remuneration that has been granted for the financial year 2016 are based on the outcome of performance indicators at the NN Group as a whole and individual performance indicators of members of the Executive Board. And these performance indicators are in part, financial by nature and in part, nonfinancial. So when we're talking about financial performance indicators, that would be, for instance, the underlying result after taxes and the costcut targets. And when we talk about nonfinancial performance indicators, we would be looking at customer satisfaction, the NPS, for instance. And employee engagement. For Mr. Friese and Mr. Rueda, based on these indicators, we awarded a variable remuneration of 20%. So I'm talking about 2016. And when we established this remuneration, this variable remuneration, the Supervisory Board decided that both members have succeeded very well in realizing a successful implementation of the NN strategy, in other words, creating a solid and sustainable independence company. And they've been able to continue that in 2016. And a very important development that supports this strategy is, obviously, the acquisition of Delta Lloyd. And furthermore, we're also pleased to see that the employee engagement has remained more or less stable. And that customer satisfaction has developed in a positive direction. Now all these elements have been considered when we awarded the variable remuneration. As you know, the Supervisory Board, every year, in accordance with the established remuneration policy, will assess the level of remuneration of the Executive Board in the light of the remuneration of our peers, both in the financial and nonfinancial sector. And of course, we always avail ourselves of the recommendations of our external consultants. The remuneration policy was established in 2015, as I said. And it was also established that the level would be just below the median of the peer group. Now benchmark regarding remuneration has shown that remuneration of Mr. Friese is far below the median of this group and also remuneration of Mr. Rueda is much below the median of this group. And this difference becomes even clearer and bigger if we take into account the new peer group that we have as a consequence of the acquisition of Delta Lloyd, which is why the Supervisory Board had decided to increase the fixed salary of Mr. Friese as of the 1st of January 2017, to increase it by 10% and as for the 1st of January 2018, an increase of 15%. And thereby we've taken into account the increased size and complexity of the combined NN, Delta Lloyd organization. As far as Mr. Rueda is concerned, we decided that as per the 1st of January 2017, his fixed salary will be increased by 5%; and as per the 1st of January next year, he will have an increase of 10%. Also, keeping in mind the increased size and complexity. Now I would like to highlight that this increase of salaries of both Executive Board members -- with this increase, the remuneration of both gentlemen is still under or below the median of the peer group. Now the policy that you established in 2015 is a policy that is transparent and that fits these times.

Now I'd like to give the floor back to our Chairman.",   Thank you  Ladies and gentlemen I would like to briefly explain the remuneration of the members of the   But before I do so I would first like to make some general remarks on the company's remuneration policy which is clear transparent and applicable to all NN employees Our remuneration policy with which we at NN are able to attract and retain qualified employees were quite aware as members of the Supervisory  that the remuneration's topic is quite sensitive and is getting a lot of public attention In the drafting and the implementation of the remuneration policy as a Supervisory  we also keep in mind the interest of the different stakehols of NN  So that would be our cnts first and foremost sharehols employees and also the society in which NN operates which is both in the Netherlands and in other countries An issue here is to find a good balance in which we consi the international nature of the company as well We make sure that the remuneration policy as the NN  supports the long-term goals of the company which is focusing on cnts' interest solid operation and   And in or to achieve these goals it's absolutely necessary to attract and retain qualified employees NN as an international company And our standards in terms of quality are very high And so therefore we're also looking at the international labor market in or to be able to attract the right employees Now these are my general remarks in terms of remuneration policy And now I'd like to zoom in on the  product --  The remuneration policy for the   has been established by the  Meeting of Sharehols in May  and has been applicable since the st of uary  This remuneration policy is in  as you know with the law on remuneration policy for financial companies the WBFO ph which means variable remuneration of a maximum of % The fixed remuneration will consist of % of an amount of money and % will consist of an amount in shares in the NN  And the members of the   must retain the shares that they receive for a period of five years And furthermore they also can claim further conditions perks and for the pension system the   has the same pension system as all other employees of NN Ladies and gentlemen variable remuneration that has been granted for the financial year  are based on the outcome of performance indicators at the NN  as a whole and individual performance indicators of members of the   And these performance indicators are in p financial by nature and in p nonfinancial So when we're talking about financial performance indicators that would be for instance the unlying result after taxes and the costcut targets And when we talk about nonfinancial performance indicators we would be looking at customer satisfaction the NPS for instance And employee engagement For Mr  and Mr  based on these indicators we awarded a variable remuneration of % So I'm talking about  And when we established this remuneration this variable remuneration the Supervisory  decided that both members have succeeded very well in realizing a successful implementation of the NN  in other words creating a solid and sustainable indepence company And they've been able to continue that in  And a very important development that supports this  is obviously the acquisition of ta Lloyd And furthermore we're also pleased to see that the employee engagement has remained more or less stable And that customer satisfaction has developed in a positive direction Now all these elements have been consied when we awarded the variable remuneration As you know the Supervisory  every year in accordance with the established remuneration policy will assess the level of remuneration of the   in the light of the remuneration of our peers both in the financial and nonfinancial sector And of course we always avail ourselves of the recommendations of our external consultants The remuneration policy was established in  as I said And it was also established that the level would be just below the median of the peer  Now benchmark regarding remuneration has shown that remuneration of Mr  is far below the median of this  and also remuneration of Mr  is much below the median of this  And this difference becomes even clearer and bigger if we take into  the new peer  that we have as a consequence of the acquisition of ta Lloyd which is why the Supervisory  had decided to increase the fixed salary of Mr  as of the st of uary  to increase it by % and as for the st of uary  an increase of % And thereby we've taken into  the increased size and complexity of the combined NN ta Lloyd organization As far as Mr  is concerned we decided that as per the st of uary  his fixed salary will be increased by %; and as per the st of uary next year he will have an increase of % Also keeping in mind the increased size and complexity Now I would like to highlight that this increase of salaries of both   members -- with this increase the remuneration of both gentlemen is still un or below the median of the peer  Now the policy that you established in  is a policy that is transparent and that fits these times It's also a policy in which we can take into  all our stakehols as well as our long-term goals of our company Now I'd like to give the floor back to our Chairman,gentleman remuneration member remark company remuneration policy employee remuneration policy employee member remuneration topic lot attention drafting implementation remuneration policy mind interest stakehol cnt sharehols employee society country issue balance nature company remuneration policy term goal company cnt interest operation goal employee company standard term quality labor market employee remark term remuneration policy product remuneration policy meeting uary remuneration policy law remuneration policy company ph remuneration maximum % remuneration % amount money % amount share member share period year condition perk pension system pension system employee gentleman remuneration year outcome performance indicator performance indicator member performance indicator p nature p performance indicator instance unlying result taxis target performance indicator customer satisfaction instance employee engagement indicator remuneration % remuneration remuneration member implementation word indepence company development acquisition employee engagement customer satisfaction direction element remuneration year accordance remuneration policy level remuneration light remuneration peer sector course recommendation consultant remuneration policy level median peer benchmark remuneration remuneration median remuneration median difference peer consequence acquisition salary uary % uary increase % size complexity organization uary salary % uary year increase % mind size complexity increase salary member increase remuneration gentleman median peer policy policy time policy stakehol term goal company floor,"['remuneration', 'member', 'remark', 'remuneration', 'employee', 'remuneration', 'employee', 'member', 'remuneration', 'topic', 'attention', 'draft', 'implementation', 'remuneration', 'stakehol', 'sharehols', 'employee', 'society', 'nature', 'remuneration', 'goal', 'goal', 'employee', 'standard', 'labor', 'employee', 'remark', 'remuneration', 'remuneration', 'meeting', 'uary', 'remuneration', 'law', 'remuneration', 'remuneration', 'maximum', 'remuneration', 'member', 'perk', 'employee', 'remuneration', 'outcome', 'indicator', 'indicator', 'member', 'indicator', 'nature', 'indicator', 'instance', 'unlye', 'taxis', 'indicator', 'satisfaction', 'instance', 'employee', 'engagement', 'indicator', 'remuneration', 'remuneration', 'remuneration', 'member', 'implementation', 'indepence', 'employee', 'engagement', 'satisfaction', 'direction', 'remuneration', 'remuneration', 'remuneration', 'light', 'remuneration', 'peer', 'sector', 'recommendation', 'consultant', 'remuneration', 'median', 'peer', 'benchmark', 'remuneration', 'remuneration', 'median', 'remuneration', 'median', 'peer', 'consequence', 'salary', 'uary', 'uary', 'complexity', 'organization', 'uary', 'salary', 'uary', 'complexity', 'salary', 'member', 'remuneration', 'median', 'peer', 'stakehol', 'goal', 'floor']",178,1354,52,7.606741573033708,3.423076923076923,104,0.06622722,0.00088466244,0.07678953,0.0011139492,0.05663999,0.00061996933,0.00092762895,0.0009345563,0.00096860545,0.0013158285,0.0010109216,0.04810353,0.0011099038,0.0006694334,0.0013540921,0.0006712243,0.00091195235,0.0015457012,0.0010962554,0.00048630612,0.001037262,0.00076782063,0.00011483531,0.7318606,0.00071010395,0.00089919916,0.0012289664,topic_24

The first is there's no one thing. We just said over $2.3 billion returned to our shareholders. It's done over a period of time. I think when you do an ASR, in many ways, it boxes you out of the market, and it forces you into a contractual obligation that reduces your flexibility. So you don't want to make it so large that you've lost all flexibility in the way you manage your capital. The fact that we have a $300 million ASR doesn't mean that we can't follow that with additional actions after that. So I think it's simply a question of making sure that we maintain the flexibility that we need in managing our capital. I think our bona fides in capital management have been well proven. We have been very consistent with our shareholders about our commitment to an intelligent shareholder-friendly capital management. As we've just noted, we've already returned 115% of all the operating income including the PartnerRe breakup fee year-todate.

On Bangalore International Airport, you've got an airport that has going from $30 million to $60 million in a few years and then ultimately to $90 million and you have a purchaser buying 10% from us of our holding company for $2.7 billion to refer to -- when you -- and have an asset like that to worry about COVID-19 or term value of Bangalore International Airport, the third largest airport in India with that type of growth. When Shanghai Airport might be a $20 billion and other airports would be like multiples of $3 billion, so we don't think it has any impact at all Mikel. And the second point you make is a good point. It's, we're very careful, we're not -- that's why we're quite optimistic, because stock prices are dirty. The markets might be high, because of Microsoft and Amazon and all of these. But I'm looking at stock prices, actual stock prices of companies that I know and there's a ton of them that are that are very cheap. That doesn't mean it won't go lower, it might go lower who knows. But we think there's enough there that meets Ben Graham as you said, buying below intrinsic value and taking a long-term approach. And as I began our prepared remarks, every year we've gone down Mikel, we've -- the next year, we've gone up. And there's no guarantee that will happen, but we're hoping that will be the case.
